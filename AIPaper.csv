The Fractional programming technique is useful in dealing with real life situations where the decision maker has to maximize or minimize the ratios of two objective functions. In any hierarchical system or decentralized system, multi level programming problem can be used to obtain efficient solution based on the preferences of each decision maker at each level. The usage of fractional method and level wise preference in real life problems helps us to obtain the efficiency of system and also enables hierarchical decision making which is common in day to day transportation firms. An equivalent deterministic model has been obtained for the multi level four dimensional fractional multi item transportation problem under uncertain environment by using expected and chance constrain model of uncertainty theory. Then the deterministic model is solved by using the modified fuzzy goal programming technique to obtain the compromise solution of the proposed model. The validity of the proposed model has been explained using the numerical example © 2021, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design. The discussion notes the state-of-the-art techniques such as the ensemble method of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI as well as the absence of Russia in the list of top countries for scientific output. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119292254

A Nonlinear Auto Regressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network model was fitted to predict Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the North Lagoon of Tunis as an eutrophication indicator. The modeling is based on approximately three decades of monitoring water quality data (from January 1989 to April 2018) to train, validate and test the NARX model. The most relevant predictor variables used in this model were those having a high permutation importance ranking with Random Forest (RF) model, which simplified the structure of the network, resulting in a more accurate and efficient procedure. Those predictor variables are secchi depth, and dissolved oxygen. Various model scenarios with different NARX architectures were tested for Chl-a prediction. To verify the model performances, the trained models were applied to field monitoring data. Results indicated that the developed NARX model can predict Chl-a concentrations in the North Lagoon of Tunis with high accuracy (R = 0.79; MSE = 0.31). In addition, results showed that the NARX model generally performed better than multivariate linear regression (MVLR). This approach could provide a quick assessment of Chl-a variations for lagoon management and eco-restoration. © 2021, Society of Wetland Scientists.",Eutrophication; Forecasting; Machine Learning; NARX; North Lagoon of Tunis; Random Forest,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119118200

In this context, a large volume of data is being generated, and technologies such as big data analytics are needed to create opportunities for open innovation by obtaining valuable knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of big data analytics and evaluate the relationship it has with performance and knowledge management, taking into consideration that this technology is in its initial stages and that previous research has provided varied results depending on the sector in focus. To address these challenges, a theoretical framework is developed to empirically test the relationship of these variables; 265 members of universities in Latin America were surveyed, and structural equation modeling is used. The findings identify compatibility, an adequate organizational data environment, and external support as factors required to adopt big data analytics, and their positive relationship is tested with knowledge management processes and organizational performance.

In this context, delineation of groundwater potential zones is essential for meeting the demand of different sectors. In this research, the integrated approach consisting of analytical hierarchy process (AHP), multiple influence factors (MIF) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was applied. The demarcation of groundwater potential zones is based on thematic maps, namely Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hillshade, soil texture, slope, groundwater depth, geomorphology, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and flow direction and accumulation. The pairwise comparison matrix has been created, and weights are assigned to each thematic layer. The comparative score to every factor was calculated from the overall weight of two major and minor influences. Groundwater potential zones were classified into five classes, namely very poor, poor, moderate, good and very good, which cover an area as follows: 3.33 km2, 785.84 km2, 1147.47 km2, 595.82 km2 and 302.65 km2, respectively, based on AHP method.

More benchmarks are needed to design and test the generality of the proposed approaches. This paper is the first to define the requirements on these benchmarks. It highlights that there are only two benchmarks that can be used for supervised learning among the six publicly available ones we found in the literature.

These new technologies offer high density and consume zero leakage power and can bridge the gap between processor and memory. The desirable properties of emerging NVMs make them suitable candidates for several applications including replacement of conventional memories. However, their unique characteristics introduce new data privacy and security issues. Some of them are already available in the market as discrete chips or a part of full system implementation. They are considered to become ubiquitous in future computing devices. Therefore, it is important to ensure their security/privacy issues. Note that these NVMs can be considered for cache, main memory, or storage application. They are also suitable to implement in-memory computation which increases system throughput and eliminates von Neumann bottleneck. Compute-capable NVMs impose new security and privacy challenges that are fundamentally different than their storage counterpart.

We implement our proposed floorplanning methods as a package for Dynamo, a visual programming tool, with a custom GUI and additional evaluation functionalities to facilitate designers in their generative design workflow. Furthermore, we illustrate the performance of GenFloor in two sets of case-study experiments for residential floorplanning tasks by (a) measuring the ability of the proposed system to find a known optimal solution, and (b) observing how the system can generate diverse floorplans while addressing given a constant residential design problem.

We analyse if gender inequalities also manifest themselves in online populations of professionals by leveraging audience estimates from LinkedIn’s advertisement platform to explore gender gaps among LinkedIn users across countries, ages, industries and seniorities. We further validate LinkedIn gender gaps against ground truth professional gender gap indicators derived from the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Statistical Database, and examine the feasibility and biases of predicting global professional gender gap indicators using gender gaps computed from LinkedIn’s online population. We find that women are significantly underrepresented relative to men on LinkedIn in countries in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, among older individuals, in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields and higher-level managerial positions. Furthermore, a simple, aggregate indicator of the female-to-male ratio of LinkedIn users, which we term the LinkedIn Gender Gap Index (GGI), shows strong positive correlations with ILO ground truth professional gender gaps. A parsimonious regression model using the LinkedIn GGI to predict ILO professional gender gaps enables us to expand country coverage of different ILO indicators, albeit with better performance for general professional gender gaps than managerial gender gaps. Nevertheless, predictions generated using the LinkedIn population show some distinctive biases. Notably, we find that in countries where there is greater gender inequality in internet access, LinkedIn data predict greater gender equality than the ground truth, indicating an overrepresentation of high status women online in these settings. Our work contributes to a growing literature seeking to harness the ‘data revolution’ for global sustainable development by evaluating the potential of a novel data source for filling gender data gaps and monitoring key indicators linked to women’s economic empowerment. © 2021, The Author(s).",Data for Development; Digital Demography; Gender; LinkedIn; Sustainable Development Goals,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111502625

Any host or device that is exposed on the internet is a prime target for cyberattacks. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is accountable for the majority of these cyberattacks. Although various solutions have been proposed by researchers to mitigate this issue, cybercriminals always adapt their attack approach to circumvent countermeasures. One of the modified DoS attacks is known as distributed reflection denial-of-service attack (DRDoS). This type of attack is considered to be a more severe variant of the DoS attack and can be conducted in transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). However, this attack is not effective in the TCP protocol due to the three-way handshake approach that prevents this type of attack from passing through the network layer to the upper layers in the network stack. On the other hand, UDP is a connectionless protocol, so most of these DRDoS attacks pass through UDP. This study aims to examine and identify the differences between TCP-based and UDP-based DRDoS attacks. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

However, various strategies for determining cities' smartness/smart development levels are mostly inconclusive by not considering all the dimensions in urban space in their assessments. This study adopted a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique to model the smartness/smart development levels of a developing country city using a six-dimensional framework which provides a comprehensive perspective on the characterization of urban frameworks of cities. A positivism research philosophy using deductive approach and purposive sampling technique was adopted. Quantitative data were collected from experts using a close-ended questionnaire in which 76 responses were retrieved. The study modeled eight indicators for each of the six dimensions using FSE to determine the smartness/smart development level index of each dimension towards the determination of the overall smartness/smart development level index of the developing country city. After analysis, the developing country city and each of the six dimensions used to characterize the city were determined as fairly developed. The implications of such level of ranking meant that the city is below the acceptable smart city status, and hence, improvement should be made in policy applications along the 48 identified indicators such as empowering human resources, sustainable resource consumption, etc., to propel the six dimensions towards smart city. This study could also serve as a theoretical model for determining the smartness/smart development levels of developing countries’ cities. The study also reveals aspects in the urban framework where policy makers and urban developers could target to improve the smartness/smart development levels of cities towards the smart city status. © 2021 The Authors",Applications; Developing countries.

We evaluate 26 text pre-processings applied to Arabic tweets within the process of training a classifier to identify health-related tweets. For this task we use the (traditional) machine learning classifiers KNN, SVM, Multinomial NB and Logistic Regression. Furthermore, we report experimental results with the deep learning architectures BLSTM and CNN for the same text classification problem. Since word embeddings are more typically used as the input layer in deep networks, in the deep learning experiments we evaluate several state-of-the-art pre-trained word embeddings with the same text pre-processing applied. To achieve these goals, we use two data sets: one for both training and testing, and another for testing the generality of our models only. Our results point to the conclusion that only four out of the 26 pre-processings improve the classification accuracy significantly. For the first data set of Arabic tweets, we found that Mazajak CBOW pre-trained word embeddings as the input to a BLSTM deep network led to the most accurate classifier with F1 score of 89.7%. For the second data set, Mazajak Skip-Gram pre-trained word embeddings as the input to BLSTM led to the most accurate model with F1 score of 75.2% and accuracy of 90.7% compared to F1 score of 90.8% achieved by Mazajak CBOW for the same architecture but with lower accuracy of 70.89%.

With the rise of financial technology (FinTech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security. However, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics. Previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (TAM) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies. This study therefore modifies the TAM as a basic research architecture. Based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, “perceived privacy” and “perceived trust,” to extend the traditional TAM to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in FinTech applications. First, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework. Second, we use the AHP results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria. The results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identification methods in FinTech applications.

Although it is not as popular as before, from time to time we still find crowds of players gathered in some spots where Pokémon appear. Numerous reports have explored this Pokémon phenomenon; however, the exact reasons for its popularity remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the post-adoption behavior of Pokémon Go players and its influential factors in the gaming and tourism industries. The theoretical model of stimulus-organism-response was drawn on to examine the impact of the environmental stimuli (social influence and media influence) on players’ internal organisms, which in turn affect their post-experience responses. Moreover, gender differences were also examined in the hypothetical relationships. A total of 342 valid questionnaires from actual gamers were collected in this study, and data analysis was performed using a structural equation model. The results show that stimulus effects, such as social stimuli (critical mass and social interaction) and media stimuli (content timeliness and media richness), have significant impacts on the players’ internal gamified experience (attachment and conformity), which in turn affect their visit intention to catch creatures at certain attractions and to continue playing Pokémon Go. Further, we have also found that players’ intention to visit Pokémon spots is significantly correlated with their intention to continue playing the game. Findings provide links between gamification and tourism literature.

Preparing a Landslide susceptibility mapping is imperative to manage the landslide hazard and reduce damages of properties and loss of lives. GIS-based frequency ratio, information value, and certainty factor methods were applied. The landslide inventory map was prepared from detailed fieldwork and Google Earth imagery interpretation. Thus, 514 landslides were mapped, and out of which 359 (70%) of landslides were randomly selected keeping their spatial distribution to build landslide susceptibility models, while the remaining 155 (30%) of the landslides were used to model validation. In this study, six factors, including lithology, land use/cover, distance to stream, slope gradient, slope aspect, and slope curvature were evaluated. The effects of the landslide factor of slope instability were determined by comparing with landslide inventory raster using the GIS environment. The landslide susceptibility maps of the Uatzau area were categorized into very low, low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility classes. The landslide susceptibility maps of the three models validated by the ROC curve. The results for the area under the curve (AUC) are 88.83% for the frequency ratio model, 87.03% for certainty factor, and 84.83% of information value models, which are indicating very good accuracy in the identification of landslide susceptibility zones of a region.

This study investigates the use of different verbs to encode various weather events in Sinitic languages, a language family spoken over a wide range of climates and with 3000 years of continuous textual documentation. We propose to synergise the many concepts of kinesis that grew from Aristotle’s original ideas to account for the correlation between meteorological events and their linguistic encoding. It is observed that the two most salient key factors of weather events, i.e., mass of weather substances and speed of weather processes, are the two contributing components of kinetic energy. Leveraging the linguistic theory that kinesis underpins conceptualisation of verb classes, this paper successfully accounts for the selection of verbs for different meteorological events in all Sinitic languages in terms of both language variations and changes. Specifically, weather events with bigger weather substances and faster weather processes tend to select action verbs with high transitivity. The kinesis driven accounts also predict the typological variations between verbal and nominal constructions for weather expressions. The correlation between kinesis and the selection of verbs is further corroborated by an experiment on the perception of native Sinitic language speakers, as well as analyses of regional variations of verb selections that do not follow general typological patterns. It is found that such typological exceptions generally correspond to variations in meteorological patterns. By explicating the pivotal role of kinesis in bridging weather events and the linguistic encoding of weather, this study underlines the role of cognition as the conceptualisation of physical and sensory inputs to sharable knowledge encoded by language. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098647274

Despite evidence to the contrary, utility maximization is often the implicit theoretical assumption underlying agricultural decision-making processes. This study undertakes an exploratory approach to test alternative theories of human decision-making on the process of agricultural adaptation of farmers in India by synthesizing multiple sources of social and environmental data. We developed an empirical agent-based model (ABM) to simulate past adoption decisions of six agricultural adaptation strategies of 959 farmers in northern India. The model assessed the fit of four major decision-making rules – utility maximization, self-satisficing, social norms, and random choice for farmers differentiated by farm size. Scenario analysis was conducted to test whether (and which) alternative decision-making rules offered a better explanation of the adoption of (which) adaptation strategies. Results demonstrated that the utility-maximizing decision rule had a higher fit for productivity-enhancing adaptation strategies, such as adopting high yield varieties and enhanced fertilizer use, with model performance increasing, generally, with farm size. The adoption of climate tolerant varieties by farmers was most closely guided by self-satisficing and social norms decision-rules, with the model performance, under both scenarios, highest for marginal landholders. Marginal farmers are more likely to use these heuristics to adopt climate tolerant varieties as their decisions may not necessarily be geared towards increasing profit, unlike larger farmers. Social norms had a higher fit for the adoption of climate-related strategies, including enhanced irrigation, with model fit increasing, generally, with farm size. Agricultural policy and extension efforts that incorporate the varied motivations and heuristics of agricultural decision-making, rather than assuming adaptation as a utility maximization exercise, can better design, develop, and disseminate solutions to support the adaptive capacity of farmers. © 2021 The Authors",Adaptation; Agent-based models; Agriculture; Decision-making; India,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111562128

This paper will discuss weed detection using remote sensing techniques, and algorithms commonly used to differentiate them from crops are deliberated. However, weed detection in rice fields using remote sensing platforms is still in its early stages; weed detection in other crops is also discussed. Results show that machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) remote sensing techniques have successfully produced a high accuracy map for detecting weeds in crops using RS platforms. There-fore, this technology positively impacts weed management in many aspects, especially in terms of the economic perspective.

In the study we used unsupervised learning to automatically cluster hydraulic flow units (HU) based on flow zone indicators (FZI) in a core plug dataset. Then we applied supervised learning to predict HU by combining core and well log data. We tested several machine learning algorithms. In the first phase, we derived hydraulic flow unit clustering of porosity and permeability of core data using unsupervised machine learning methods such as Ward’s, K mean, Self-Organize Map (SOM) and Fuzzy C mean (FCM). Then we applied supervised machine learning methods including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Boosted Tree (BT) and Random Forest (RF). We combined both core and log data to predict HU logs for the full well section of the wells without core data. We used four wells with six logs (GR, DT, NPHI, LLD, LSS and RHOB) and 578 cores from the Miocene reservoir to train, validate and test the data. Our goal was to show that the correct combination of cores and well logs data would provide reservoir engineers with a tool for HU classification and estimation of permeability in a continuous geological profile. Our research showed that machine learning effectively boosts the prediction of permeability, reduces uncertainty in reservoir modeling, and improves project economics. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, accurately identifying future changing patterns in the flood risk is essential. For this purpose, this study elaborated a new framework for a basin scale that employs a future land-use simulation model, a factor spatialization technique, and a novel hybrid model for scenario-based flood risk assessment in 2030 and 2050. Three land-use scenarios (i.e., natural growth scenario, cropland protection scenario, and ecological protection scenario) were set and applied in Jinjiang Basin to explore the changes in future flood risk under these scenarios. The results indicate the different degrees of increase in flood risk that will occur in the three scenarios. Under the natural growth (NG) scenario, the city will expand rapidly with the growth of population and economy, and the total area with high and very high flood risk will increase by 371.30 km2 by 2050, as compared to 2020. However, under the ecological protection (EP) scenario, woodlands will be protected, and the growth in population, economy, and built-up lands will slow down with slightly increased risk of flooding. In this scenario, the total area with high and very high flood risk will increase by 113.75 km2 by 2050. Under the cropland protection (CP) scenario, the loss of croplands will have been effectively stopped, and the flood risk will not show a significant increase under this scenario, with an increase by only 90.96 km2 by 2050, similar to the EP scenario. Spatially, these increased flood risks mainly locate at the periphery of existing built-up lands, and the high-flood-risk zones are mainly distributed in the southeast of the Jinjiang Basin. The information about increasing flood risk determined by the framework provides insight into the spatio-temporal characteristics of future flood-prone areas, which facilitates reasonable flood mitigation measures to be developed at the most critical locations in the region. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, there is a need to investigate the existing barriers to EDUC4 implementation. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a systematic literature review of journal articles in the Scopus database was conducted. Of the 299 journal articles generated from the initial search on Scopus, 30 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The content analysis yielded 12 barriers which include cybersecurity threat, costly, skills gap of human capital, apprehensive stakeholders, lack of training resources, lack of collaboration, knowledge gap for the customization of curriculum design, insufficient available technologies, health issues, time constraint for material preparation, complexity of learning platforms, and insufficient foundation of basic education. They were then associated with seven themes for better operationalization in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs): (1) human resources, (2) infrastructure, (3) financial, (4) linkages, (5) educational management, (6) learners, and (7) health and environment. Finally, a theoretical predictive model was constructed to present the causal relationships in modeling the problems associated with implementing EDUC4.

These factors were studied using different technology acceptance models and theories. However, a systematic review that offers extensive understanding into what affects healthcare technologies and services and covers distinctive trends in large-scale research remains lacking. Therefore, this review aims to systematically review the articles published on technology acceptance in healthcare. From a yield of 1768 studies collected, 142 empirical studies have met the eligibility criteria and were extensively analyzed. The key findings confirmed that TAM and UTAUT are the most prevailing models in explaining what affects the acceptance of various healthcare technologies through different user groups, settings, and countries. Apart from the core constructs of TAM and UTAUT, the results showed that anxiety, computer self-efficacy, innovativeness, and trust are the most influential factors affecting various healthcare technologies. The results also revealed that Taiwan and the USA are leading the research of technology acceptance in healthcare, with a remarkable increase in studies focusing on telemedicine and electronic medical records solutions.

It is well known that limited health literacy is associated with harmful health behaviours, the lower use of preventive services, problems in making use of healthcare resources and poor skills for the self-management of chronic disorders. This study analysed the level and factors associated with HL in high school students in southern Poland. The study is based on the data from a paper-and-pencil survey of high schools students in the Malopolska Voivodshop. The students were selected using a two-stage cluster random sampling procedure. The level of HL was assessed with the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire, consisting of 47 items. Univariate logistic and linear regression models were applied to analyse the association between general HL score and the main domain-specific indices. The respondents whose parents had attended University and came from more affluent families were less likely to demonstrate limited HL. There was a significant positive relationship between the self-assessment of the economic situation, size of accommodation, the level of expenditure on a mobile phone and receiving external support, the size of the book collection at home, and domain-specific HL sub-indices. In conclusion, among socio-demographic factors, the parents’ education is the only consistent predictor of the level of HL in high school students. Furthermore, most variables reflecting the economic status of the respondent’s family are significantly associated with the general HL score and its sub-indices. © 2021 by the authors.

Finally, residual analysis method and accumulate slope change rate are used to identify the impact of human activities and climate change on NDVI. The research results show the following: (1) The NDVI value in most areas of Qinling Mountains is at a medium-to-high level, and 99.76% of the areas correspond to an increasing trend of NDVI, and the significantly increased area accounts for more than 20%. (2) From 1981 to 2019, the NDVI of the Qinling Mountains increased from 0.63 to 0.78, showing an overall upward trend, and it increased significantly after 2006. (3) Sensitivity analysis results show that the western high-altitude area of Qinling Mountain area dominated by grassland is mainly affected by precipitation. The central and southeastern parts of the Qinling Mountains are significantly affected by temperature, and they are mainly distributed in areas dominated by forest. (4) The contribution rates of climate change and human activities to NDVI are 36.04% and 63.96%, respectively. Among them, the positive impact of human activities on the NDVI of the Qinling Mountains accounted for 99.85% of the area. The area with significant positive effect accounted for 36.49%.

The multinational nature of the hardware supply chain has led to a host of security threats, including IP piracy, IC overproduction, and Trojan insertion. To combat these, researchers have proposed logic locking techniques to protect the intellectual properties of the design and increase the difficulty of malicious modification of its functionality. However, the adoption of logic locking approaches has been rather slow due to the lack of integration with the IC production process and the lack of efficacy of existing algorithms. This work automates the logic locking process by developing software using Python that performs the locking on a gate-level netlist, which can be integrated with the existing digital synthesis tools. Analysis of the latest logic locking algorithms has demonstrated that the SFLL-HD algorithm is one of the most secure and versatile when trading-off levels of protection against different types of attacks and was thus selected for implementation. The presented tool can also be expanded to incorporate the latest locking mechanisms to keep up with the fast-paced development in this field. The paper also presents a case study to demonstrate the functionality of the tool and how it could be used to explore the design space and compare different locking solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

A significant issue of the Indian rivers is the massive water pollution, leading to the spreading of different diseases due to its daily use. Therefore, this study investigates three aspects. The first one is testing the hypothesis of the existence of a monotonic trend of the series of eight water parameters of the Brahmaputra River recorded for 17 years at ten hydrological stations. When this hypothesis was rejected, a loess trend was fitted. The second aspect is to assess the water quality using three indicators (WQI)–CCME WQI, British Colombia, and a weighted index. The third aspect is to group the years and the stations in clusters used to determine the regional (spatial) and temporal trend of the WQI series, utilizing a new algorithm. A statistical analysis does not reject the hypothesis of a monotonic trend presence for the spatially distributed data but not for the temporal ones. Hierarchical clustering based on the computed WQIs detected two clusters for the spatially distributed data and two for the temporal-distributed data. The procedure proposed for determining the WQI temporal and regional evolution provided good results in terms of mean absolute error, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). © 2021 by the authors.

Often deployed in large numbers, they usually consist of low-cost components where failures are the norm, even more so in harsh outdoor environments. Current fault detection techniques, however, consider the sensor data alone and neglect vital information from the nodes’ hard-and software. As a consequence, they can not distinguish between rare data anomalies caused by proper events in the sensed data on one side and fault-induced data distortion on the other side. In this paper, we contribute with a novel, open-source sensor node platform for monitoring applications such as environmental monitoring. For long battery life, it comprises mainly low-power components. In contrast to other sensor nodes, our platform provides self-diagnostic measures to enable active node-level reliability. The entire sensor node platform including the hardware and software components has been implemented and is publicly available and free to use for everyone. Based on an extensive and long-running practical experiment setup, we show that the detectability of node faults is improved and the distinction between rare but proper events and fault-induced data distortion is indeed possible. We also show that these measures have a negligible overhead on the node’s energy efficiency and hardware costs. This improves the overall reliability of wireless sensor networks with both, long battery life and high-quality data. © 2021 by the authors.

We approach this problem by exploring neural networks for forecasting of house prices from one hundred major cities for the period of June 2010–May 2019, serving as the first study with such wide coverage for the emerging Chinese market through a machine learning technique. We aim at constructing simple and accurate neural networks as a contribution to pure technical forecasting of house prices. To facilitate the analysis, we investigate different model settings over the algorithm (the Levenberg-Marquardt, scaled conjugate gradient, and Bayesian regularization), delay (from two to six), hidden neuron (two, three, five, and eight), and data spitting ratio (70%–15%–15%, 60%–20%–20%, and 80%–10%–10% for trainingvalidationtesting), and arrive at a rather simple neural network with only four delays and three hidden neurons that leads to stable performance of 1% average relative root mean square error across the one hundred cities for the training, validation, and testing phases. We demonstrate the usefulness of the machine learning approach to the house price forecasting problem in the Chinese market. Our results could be used on a standalone basis or combined with fundamental forecasting in forming perspectives of house price trends and conducting policy analysis. Our empirical framework should not be difficult to deploy, which is an important consideration to many decision makers, and has potential to be generalized for house price forecasting of other cities in China. © 2021 The Author(s)",Forecasting; House price; Neural network,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118792679

As all non?empty subsets in frequent itemsets are still frequent itemsets, all frequent itemsets can be acquired only by finding all maximal frequent itemsets (MFIs), whose supersets are not frequent itemsets. In this study, an algorithm, named right?hand side expanding (RHSE), which can accurately find all MFIs, was proposed. First, an Expanding Operation was designed, which, starting from any given frequent itemset, could add items using certain rules and form some supersets of given frequent itemsets. In addition, these supersets were all MFIs. Next, this operator was used to add items by taking all frequent 1?itemsets as the starting point alternately, and all MFIs were found in the end. Due to the special design of the Expanding Operation, each MFI could be found. More-over, the path found was unique, which avoided the algorithm redundancy in temporal and spatial complexity. This algorithm, which has a high operating rate, is applicable to the big data of high-dimensional mass transactions as it is capable of avoiding the computing redundancy and finding all MFIs.

Machine learning is widely used for the prediction of energy consumption. The researchers present several artificial intelligence and machine learning-based methods to improve the prediction accuracy of energy consumption. However, the discrepancy between actual energy consumption and predicted energy consumption is still challenging. Various factors, including changes in weather, holidays, and weekends, affect prediction accuracy. This article analyses the overall prediction using error curve learning and a hybrid model. Actual energy consumption data of Jeju island, South Korea, has been used for experimental purposes. We have used a hybrid ML model consisting of Catboost, Xgboost, and Multi-layer perceptron for the prediction. Then we analyze the factors that affect the week-ahead (WA) and 48 h prediction results. Mean error on weekdays is recorded as 2.78%, for weekends 2.79%, and for special days it is recorded as 4.28%. We took into consideration significant predicting errors and looked into the reasons behind those errors. Furthermore, we analyzed whether factors, such as a sudden change in temperature and typhoons, had an effect on energy consumption. Finally, the authors have considered the other factors, such as public holidays and weekends, to analyze the significant errors in the prediction.

With the ceaseless increase in market capitalization, stock trading has become a center of investment for many financial investors. Many analysts and researchers have developed tools and techniques that predict stock price movements and help investors in proper decision-making. Advanced trading models enable researchers to predict the market using non-traditional textual data from social platforms. The application of advanced machine learning approaches such as text data analytics and ensemble methods have greatly increased the prediction accuracies. Meanwhile, the analysis and prediction of stock markets continue to be one of the most challenging research areas due to dynamic, erratic, and chaotic data. This study explains the systematics of machine learning-based approaches for stock market prediction based on the deployment of a generic framework. Findings from the last decade (2011–2021) were critically analyzed, having been retrieved from online digital libraries and databases like ACM digital library and Scopus. Furthermore, an extensive comparative analysis was carried out to identify the direction of significance. The study would be helpful for emerging researchers to understand the basics and advancements of this emerging area, and thus carry-on further research in promising directions. © 2021 by the authors.

This problem has been extensively studied in the literature, and the most popular technique is dark channel prior (DCP). However, dark channel prior tends to underestimate transmissions of bright areas or objects, which may cause color distortions during dehazing. This paper proposes a new single-image dehazing method that combines dark channel prior with bright channel prior in order to overcome the limitations of dark channel prior. A patch-based robust atmospheric light estimation was introduced in order to divide image into regions to which the DCP assumption and the BCP assumption are applied. Moreover, region adaptive haze control parameters are introduced in order to suppress the distortions in a flat and bright region and to increase the visibilities in a texture region. The flat and texture regions are expressed as probabilities by using local image entropy. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art image dehazing method both visually and numerically. © 2021 by the author.

Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, there is a need however for an energy storage system (ESS) to store the surplus energy and feed the energy deficit. Most renewable sources used battery storage systems (BSS), a green hydrogen storage system (GHSS), and a diesel generator as a backup for these sources. Batteries are very expensive and have a very short lifetime, and GHSS have a very expensive initial cost and many security issues. In this paper, a system consisting of wind turbines and a photovoltaic (PV) array with a pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) system as the main energy storage to replace the expensive and short lifetime batteries is proposed. The proposed system is built to feed a remote area called Dumah Aljandal in the north of Saudi Arabia. A smart grid is used via a novel demand response strategy (DRS) with a dynamic tariff to reduce the size of the components and it reduces the cost of energy compared to a flat tariff. The use of the PHES with smart DRS reduced the cost of energy by 34.2%, and 41.1% compared to the use of BSS and GHSS as an ESS, respectively. Moreover, the use of 100% green energy sources will avoid the emission of an estimated 2.5 million tons of greenhouse gases every year. The proposed system will use a novel optimization algorithm called the gradually reduced particles of particle swarm optimization (GRP-PSO) algorithm to enhance the exploration and exploitation during the searching iterations. The GRP-PSO reduces the convergence time to 58% compared to the average convergence time of 10 optimization algorithms used for comparison. A sensitivity analysis study is introduced in this paper in which the effect of ±20% change in wind speed and solar irradiance are selected and the system showed a low effect of these resources on the Levelized cost of energy of the HRES. These outstanding results proved the superiority of using a pumped-storage system with a dynamic tariff demand response strategy compared to the other energy storage systems with flat-rate tariffs. © 2021 by the authors.

It became extremely difficult for organizations and employees across sectors to operate under increased mobility restrictions. The pandemic effectively disrupted previous operational models and imbued changes such as telework and digital adoption that are pervasive and may potentially last beyond the pandemic. Amid these circumstances, it was essential to ask how organizations and employees will sustain themselves in the post-COVID-19 ”new normal”. Although so much research is conducted about COVID-19, there is no comprehensive view of the changes at the meso (organizational) and micro (individual) levels. This article aims to explain this using the emergency-learning-institutionalization-new normal (ELIN) framework, which is based on the timeline of the pandemic. The article aims to bring forth the overall trends in how organizations and employees are adapting to the pandemic, the lessons they have learned, and how they will change and adapt in a post-COVID-19 “new normal”. We have analyzed existing policy papers, articles published in business, public administration, nonprofit journals, and other studies to achieve this. We find an increasing trend towards the adoption of telework and digital tools at both meso-and micro-levels. The effective implementation of telework policies and digital transformation plans at the meso-level will ensure the sustainability of organizations and jobs in the new normal. Although these trends vary across sectors and within and across countries, there is an overall increase in the flexibility of organizations and employees in adopting new solutions, making them more open to innovation. The article makes important recommendations for organizations to make these transitions more sustainable in the medium and long term. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study is to consistently review the early scientific literature related to digital healthcare platforms, summarize key findings and study features, identify literature deficiencies, and suggest digital solutions for future research. (2) Methods: A systematic literature review using key databases was conducted to search published articles between 2010 and 2020 and identified 52 papers that focused on PRWs, different signals in the form of PRWs’ features, the findings of these studies, and peer-reviewed articles. The research features and main findings are reported in tables and figures. (3) Results: The review of 52 papers identified 22 articles for online reputation, 15 for service popularity, 16 for linguistic features, 15 for doctor–patient concordance, 7 for offline repu-tation, and 11 for trustworthiness signals. Out of 52 studies, 75% used quantitative techniques, 12% employed qualitative techniques, and 13% were mixed-methods investigations. The majority of studies retrieved larger datasets using machine learning techniques (44/52). These studies were mostly conducted in China (38), the United States (9), and Europe (3). The majority of signals were positively related to the clinical outcomes. Few studies used conventional surveys of patient treatment experience (5, 9.61%), and few used panel data (9, 17%). These studies found a high degree of correlation between these signals with clinical outcomes.

The music in videos has a sensitive influence on human emotions, perception, and imaginations, which can make people feel relaxed or sad, and so on. Therefore, it is particularly important for people who make advertising videos to understand the relationship between the physical elements of music and empathy characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the music features in an advertising video and extract the music features that make people empathize. This paper combines both methods of the power spectrum of MFCC and image RGB analysis to find the audio feature vector. In spectral analysis, the eigenvectors obtained in the analysis process range from blue (low range) to green (medium range) to red (high range). The machine learning random forest classifier is used to classify the data obtained by machine learning, and the trained model is used to monitor the development of an advertisement empathy system in real time. The result is that the optimal model is obtained with the training accuracy result of 99.173% and a test accuracy of 86.171%, which can be deemed as correct by comparing the three models of audio feature value analysis. The contribution of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) the low?frequency and high?amplitude audio in the video is more likely to resonate than the high?frequency and high?amplitude audio; (2) it is found that frequency and audio amplitude are important attributes for describing waveforms by observing the characteristics of the machine learning classifier; (3) a new audio extraction method is proposed to induce human empathy. That is, the feature value extracted by the method of spectrogram image features of audio has the most ability to arouse human empathy. © 2021 by the author.

Although there are symptomatic treatments that can increase the survivability of the disease, there are no curative treatments. The prevalence of PD and disability-adjusted life years continue to increase steadily, leading to a growing burden on patients, their fam-ilies, society and the economy. Dopaminergic medications can significantly slow down the progression of PD when applied during the early stages. However, these treatments often become less effective with the disease progression. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial for immediate interventions so that the patients can remain self-sufficient for the longest period of time possible. Unfortunately, diagnoses are often late, due to factors such as a global shortage of neurologists skilled in early PD diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools, based on artificial intelligence methods, that can perform automated diagnosis of PD, are gaining attention from healthcare services. In this re-view, we have identified 63 studies published between January 2011 and July 2021, that proposed deep learning models for an automated diagnosis of PD, using various types of modalities like brain analysis (SPECT, PET, MRI and EEG), and motion symptoms (gait, handwriting, speech and EMG). From these studies, we identify the best performing deep learning model reported for each modality and highlight the current limitations that are hindering the adoption of such CAD tools in healthcare.

Hence, we reviewed related literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detected from household, biomedical waste, and sewage to identify possible health risks and status of existing laws, regulations, and policies regarding waste disposal in South Asian (SA) countries. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in sewage and wastewater samples of Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Besides, this review reiterates the enormous amounts of PPE and other single-use plastic wastes generated from healthcare facilities and households in the SA region with inappropriate disposal, landfilling, and/or incineration techniques wind-up polluting the environment. Consequently, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in sewer treatment plant in India. Moreover, the overuse of non-biodegradable plastics during the pandemic is deteriorating plastic pollution condition and causes a substantial health risk to the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We recommend making necessary adjustments, adopting measures and strategies, and enforcement of the existing biomedical waste management and sanitation-related policy in SA countries. We propose to adopt the knowledge gaps to improve COVID-19-associated waste management and legislation to prevent further environmental pollution. Besides, the citizens should follow proper disposal procedures of COVID-19 waste to control the environmental pollution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19; Environment; Public health; Sanitation; South Asia; Waste management,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115429506

In recent decades, global climate change and human activity have been linked to the spread of C. spinifex and its impact on ecosystem and biodiversity. In order to characterize the role of climate change on this trend and highlight regions of high invasion risk, we used global distribution data and maximum entropy models (MaxEnt) to analyze suitable habitats based on four global climate models and two representative concentration pathways under different climate scenarios. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis method was also used to further verify the prediction accuracy of the model, which was statistically significant (AUC = 0.921). Climatically suitable areas of C. spinifex at present climate conditions were located at six continents including central South America, southern parts of North America and Africa, most of Mediterranean coastal European regions, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Future climate conditions may promote C. spinifex expansion into coastal regions. Meanwhile, C. spinifex in the northern hemisphere were expected to spread further southward (20-55°N; 30-55°S) compared to present potential geographical distribution. The suitable habitat area of C. spinifex would be slightly reduced in 2050 and 2070. Seasonal precipitation, precipitation of driest quarter (bio15, bio17) and mean temperature of warmest and coldest quarter (bio10, bio11) could be the major environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of C. spinifex. Preventing the spread of C. spinifex in the future will require strict phytosanitary measures to reduce colonization of new regions, such as Japan, India, Russia, and Thailand. Our research provides a foundation to focus future management efforts and prioritize area of greatest ecological concern. © 2021 The Authors",Field sandbur (Cenchrus spinifex); Invasive plant; MaxEnt model; Potential geographical distribution; Risk analysis,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115233739

As an innovative tool with a wide range of potentialities, they have been deemed suitable for an exceptional situation marked by the persistence of social distance. Yet, the turn to new technology to solve complex problems is a political decision that has broad societal implications, especially in the context of declared states of emergency. In the article we argue that the extensive use of drones by national authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a new socio-technical assemblage of actors, technologies and practices. Building on the three main uses of drones as responses to specific pandemic-related challenges (disinfection, delivery, and surveillance), we analyse the actors and the practices involved in this new socio-technical assemblage. From the empirical material, we explore potential effects of drone uses on key issues such as the technology regulatory processes, public acceptance, and security and safety concerns. © 2021 The Authors.

However, there are many barriers to knowledge exchange (KE) at the science-policy interface, including difficulties evaluating its outcomes. The aims of this study are to synthesize the literature to elucidate the a) intended and b) claimed outcomes of KE processes at the interface of environmental science and policy, as well as the c) evidence used to evaluate them and d) methods used for collecting evaluation data. Results from systematically identifying and analyzing 397 articles show that co-production, knowledge brokerage, boundary organizations, and social connections were the most common strategies for KE. KE processes commonly aimed, claimed and referred to evidence regarding the usability of knowledge (e.g. credibility, salience, legitimacy) and social outcomes (e.g. networking, awareness, learning, trust-building). They also aimed for deeper policy/economic/societal impacts and actual use of scientific knowledge within decision-making. These additional goals, however, were seldom claimed to have been achieved, although products (e.g. maps/tools) and process attributes (e.g. equity, power-relations, transparency) were commonly used for evidencing impact. Hence, this study found that success from KE at the interface of environmental science and policy comes in diverse forms and showed a divergence between what studies aim for (ambitious) and what they evidence or claim as an achievement (more modest). This may represent failures of KE processes to reach intended goals, shortcomings in evaluation literature/approaches, or mismatches between timescales of evaluation and impact. Overall, this suggests a need to better align goals with evaluation measures to plan, facilitate, and appreciate the diverse impacts of KE processes. © 2021",Co-production; Environmental management; Evidence-Based Decision-Making; Impact evaluation; Knowledge exchange; Research Impact; Science-policy; Systematic Scoping Review,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115020744

National and international closures affect over 91% of the education community of the world. E-learning is the only effective manner for educational institutions to coordinate the learning process during the global lockdown and quarantine period. Many educational institutions have instructed their students through remote learning technologies to face the effect of local closures and promote the continuity of the education process. This study examines the expected benefits of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a new model to investigate this issue using a survey collected from the students at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed on 179 useable responses. This study applied Push-Pull-Mooring theory and examined how push, pull, and mooring variables impact learners to switch to virtual and remote educational laboratories. The Protection Motivation theory was employed to explain how the potential health risk and environmental threat can influence the expected benefits from e-learning services. The findings revealed that the push factor (environmental threat) is significantly related to perceived benefits. The pull factors (e-learning motivation, perceived information sharing, and social distancing) significantly impact learners' benefits. The mooring factor, namely perceived security, significantly impacts learners’ benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Coronavirus pandemic; COVID-19; Education; Push-pull-mooring framework; Virtual laboratories,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114751484

By modeling the wind disturbance as exogenous inputs, and assuming that compensation of its effects can be achieved through quasi-static vehicle motions, this paper proposes an innovative estimation and control scheme comprising a linear dynamic filter for the estimation of such unknown inputs and requiring only position and attitude information. The filter is built upon results from Unknown Input Observer theory and allows estimation of wind and vehicle state without measurement of the wind itself. A simple feedback control law can be used to compensate for the offset position error induced by the disturbance. The proposed filter is independent of the recovery control scheme used to nullify the tracking error, as long as the corresponding applied rotor speeds are available. The solution is first checked in simulation environment by using the Robot Operating System middleware and the Gazebo simulator and then experimentally validated with a quadcopter system flying with real wind sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Disturbance observers; Quadrotors; Robotics; Robust control; ROS/Gazebo; Unknown Input-state observers,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114675456

Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic. © 2021 The Authors.

The epidemic has been first tracked in Wuhan, China, and has progressively been expanded in the entire world. The growing expansion of COVID-19 around the globe has made X-ray images crucial for accelerated diagnostics. Therefore, an effective computerized system must be established as a matter of urgency, to facilitate health care professionals in recognizing X-ray images from COVID-19 patients. In this work, we design a novel artificial intelligent-based automated X-ray image analysis framework based on an ensemble of deep optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in order to distinguish coronavirus patients from non-patients. By developing a modified version of gaining–sharing knowledge (GSK) optimization algorithm using the Opposition-based learning (OBL) and Cauchy mutation operators, the architectures of the deployed deep CNNs are optimized automatically without performing the general trial and error procedures. After obtaining the optimized CNNs, it is also very critical to identify how to decrease the number of ensemble deep CNN classifiers to ensure the classification effectiveness. To this end, a selective ensemble approach is proposed for COVID-19 X-ray based image classification using a deep Q network that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with the optimized CNNs. This approach increases the model performance in particular and therefore decreases the ensemble size of classifiers. The experimental results show that the proposed deep RL optimized ensemble approach has an excellent performance over two popular X-ray image based COVID-19 datasets. Our proposed advanced algorithm can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from the normal individuals with a significant accuracy of 0.991441, precision of 0.993568, recall (sensitivity) of 0.981445, F-measure of 0.989666 and AUC of 0.990337 for Kaggle dataset as well as an excellent accuracy of 0.987742, precision of 0.984334, recall (sensitivity) of 0.989123, F-measure of 0.984939 and AUC of 0.988466 for Mendely dataset. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19; Deep convolutional neural network; Deep reinforcement learning; Evolutionary computation; Image classification; Optimization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110001740

Using this ecosystem, the interrelationships among the stakeholders with respect to cybersecurity information sharing are analyzed, the value parameters are determined, the value functions are defined, and the values obtained by the stakeholders through simulation are calculated. Furthermore, it is investigated whether the stakeholders involved in this ecosystem can create sufficient value to sustain in the market. The outcome of this research includes an economic model for evaluating the value creation and distribution among the stakeholders. This model is a critical step forward to better align the values (i.e., utilities and profits) of stakeholders. The simulation results of the model show that end users are the main source of value generation. Cybersecurity solution providers and cybersecurity information providers get benefits from a growing installed base of end users. However, in saturated markets, there is a risk of un-sustainability of the ecosystem, as the cost of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity information cannot be recovered through their fees. The simulation model and the findings of this study can help business managers to make better decisions related to business strategies, sustainability, and pricing schemes for cybersecurity solution and cybersecurity information.

Though some researchers have investigated the linkage between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility across different geographical locations and over time, yet these studies are scarce. This study aims to bridge this gap using daily temperature and COVID-19 cases (transmissibility) by employing grey incidence analysis (GIA) models (i.e., Deng’s grey incidence analysis (DGIA), the absolute degree GIA (ADGIA), the second synthetic degree GIA (SSDGIA), the conservative (maximin) model) and correlation analysis. Data on temperature are accessed from the NASA database, while the data on COVID-19 cases are collected from the official website of the government of Pakistan. Empirical results reveal the existence of linkages between temperature and COVID-19 in all Pakistani provinces. These linkages vary from a relatively stronger to a relatively weaker linkage. Based on calculated weights, the strength of linkages is ranked across provinces as follows: Gilgit Baltistan (0.715301) > Baluchistan (0.675091) > Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (0.619893) > Punjab (0.619286) > Sindh (0.601736). The disparity in the strength of linkage among provinces is explained by the discrepancy in the intensity of temperature. Besides, the diagrammatic correlation analysis shows that temperature is inversely linked to COVID-19 cases (per million persons) over time, implying that low temperatures are associated with high COVID-19 transmissibility and vice versa. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the linkages between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility for a tropical climate country (Pakistan) using the advanced GIA models. Research findings provide an up-to-date glimpse of the outbreak and emphasize the need to raise public awareness about the devastating impacts of the COVID-19. The educational syllabus should provide information on the causes, signs, and precautions of the pandemic. Additionally, individuals should practice handwashing, social distancing, personal hygiene, mask-wearing, and the use of hand sanitizers to ensure a secure and supportive atmosphere for preventing and controlling the current pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19; Grey incidence analysis models; Pakistan; Public health; Temperature; Transmissibility,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108205318

They can be used to collect health information from users and encourage them to be physically active. Despite potential benefits of WHTs, recent studies have shown that older people have low continued use intention toward WHTs. Previous work on this topic is disjointed, and new theoretical viewpoints are required. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose an enablers and inhibitors perspective to model factors influencing continued use intention of WHTs among the elderly. To test the model, we collected data from Chinese elderly (N = 295) who had prior experience using WHTs. Findings: The study results show that social value is the strongest enabler of continued WHT use, and emotional and epistemic values and device quality also increase use continuance. Inertia and technology anxiety were identified as significant inhibitors. A post hoc importance performance map analysis revealed that while emotional value is a highly significant predictor of continued WHT use, existing WHTs do not stimulate such value in our sample. Research limitations/implications: The research findings illustrate the importance of incorporating user resistance in technology acceptance studies in general and WHT usage studies in particular. This study contributes by providing an integrative model of technology continued use intention for the elderly along with practical implications for policymakers. Originality/value: A limited number of prior studies have taken both enablers and inhibitors into account when explaining continued WHT use intention among the elderly.

There are schools in which computing education is commonplace, while the implementation seems to be lagging behind in others. There is emerging evidence that some teachers do not consider computing education relevant, meaningful and important and, thus, intentionally neglect its provision. This is problematic as understanding the principles of code and computing is crucial for agentic citizenship in the post-digital era. This paper argues that one main reason for these teachers' reluctance is the economy-driven discursive framing of computing education, which is in contrast with the socialization-oriented manner in which teachers approach their work. To contribute to resolving this issue, the present paper introduces a transversal approach to computing education. It conceptualizes code as a sociomaterial text with social and societal histories and consequences. Theoretically and conceptually, the approach draws on the pedagogy of multiliteracies. The leading idea is that digital technologies are examined with students from functional and critical dimensions and through micro and macro perspectives. The use of wearable sports technologies, such as activity wristbands, are used as practical examples to put the theoretical ideas into context. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Computing has been (re)introduced in the curricula of basic education in various countries. Some teachers are found to be reluctant to teach computing in basic education. What this paper adds This paper introduces a transversal multiliteracies-based approach for computing education. Implications for practice and policy Computing should be included in curricula and classrooms in a holistic manner that includes both functional and critical approaches to computing. © 2021 The Author.

Similarly, antecedents and consequences of the dichotomous nature of word of mouth for m-wallets have also remained obscure so far. The present research proposes to address this void in the accumulated learnings by examining both enablers and inhibitors of mobile wallets (m-wallets) as antecedents of valence of word of mouth (positive and negative; PWOM and NWOM, respectively). Grounded in Dual Factor Theory, this study aims to explore consumers’ continued use intentions resulting from the WOM valence. The findings reveal that enablers (perceived information quality, perceived ability, and perceived benefit) drive PWOM, while the inhibitors (perceived cost, perceived risk, and perceived uncertainty) spur NWOM. Furthermore, the results show that only PWOM drives the continuance intentions of m-wallet users. Therefore, the study proves that the antecedents of PWOM are different from those of NWOM. © 2020 The Author(s)",Dual factor theory; Mobile payments; Two-factor theory; WOM valence,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097472076

Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July–December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. © 2021 The Authors",Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109174880

New research has improved our understanding about the remaining options to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, through overcoming political barriers to carbon pricing, taking into account non-CO2 factors, a well-designed implementation of demand-side and nature-based solutions, resilience building of ecosystems and the recognition that climate change mitigation costs can be justified by benefits to the health of humans and nature alone. We consider new insights about what to expect if we fail to include a new dimension of fire extremes and the prospect of cascading climate tipping elements. Technical summary A synthesis is made of 10 topics within climate research, where there have been significant advances since January 2020. The insights are based on input from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings include: (1) the options to still keep global warming below 1.5 °C; (2) the impact of non-CO2 factors in global warming; (3) a new dimension of fire extremes forced by climate change; (4) the increasing pressure on interconnected climate tipping elements; (5) the dimensions of climate justice; (6) political challenges impeding the effectiveness of carbon pricing; (7) demand-side solutions as vehicles of climate mitigation; (8) the potentials and caveats of nature-based solutions; (9) how building resilience of marine ecosystems is possible; and (10) that the costs of climate change mitigation policies can be more than justified by the benefits to the health of humans and nature.

Granger causality test results signify that there exists a one-way causality from technology patent to carbon emission and from economic growth to carbon emission. We also constructed an improved Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The regression results manifest that technology patents contribute to the realization of carbon emission reduction and carbon neutralization, while the economic growth of emerging economies represented by BRICS countries significantly improves carbon emissions, but every single BRICS country shows differentiated carbon emissions conditions with their economic development stages. The impact of the interaction term on carbon emissions for the five BRICS countries also presents country-specific heterogeneity. Moreover, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) test results show that only Russia and South Africa have an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions, whereas Brazil, India and China have a U-shaped curve relationship. There exists no EKC relationship when considering BRICS nations as a whole. Further robustness tests also verify that the conclusions obtained in this paper are consistent and stable.

This paper investigates the accuracy of several forecasting technologies based on Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) in monthly rainfall forecasting. First, WPD decomposes the observed monthly rainfall data into several subcomponents. Then, three data-based models, namely Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model, group method of data handing (GMDH) model, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, are utilized to complete the prediction of the decomposed monthly rainfall series, respectively. Finally, the ensemble prediction result of the model is formulated by summing the outputs of all submodules. Meanwhile, these six models are employed for benchmark comparison to study the prediction performance of these conjunction methods, which are BPNN, WPD-BPNN, GMDH, WPD-GMDH, ARIMA, and WPD-ARIMA models. The paper takes monthly data from Luoning and Zuoyu stations in Luoyang city of China as the case study. The performance of these conjunction methods is tested by four quantitative indexes. Results show that WPD can efficiently improve the forecasting accuracy and the proposed WPD-BPNN model can achieve better prediction results. It is concluded that the hybrid forecast model is a very efficient tool to improve the accuracy of mid-and long-term rainfall forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Plastic bottle, bags, food containers, gloves, and cup that end up in landfills and environment could linger for hundreds to thousands of years. Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), will also exacerbate the global plastic pollution as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE i.e., gloves, masks) became mandatory to prevent the spread of the virus. Plastic eventually breaking down in micro & nanoscopic bits due to physical or chemical or biological actions in the environment, can enter animal and human food web. So, plastic management programs need to be more robust with a focus on the prevention of the micro and nanoplastics entrance into the environment and food web. In the present pandemic situation, it is even more necessary to know about how much plastic waste is being generated and how different countries are coping up with their plastic waste management. In this review, we have elucidated how global plastic production rise during COVID-19 and how it would contribute to short and long-term impacts on the environment. Plastic pollution during the pandemic will increase the GHS emissions in the incineration facilities. Improper disposal of plastics into the oceans and lands would endanger the marine species and subsequently human lives.

Aim: Our perspective focuses on disruptive forward-looking innovations and key technologies to further boost OCT performance and therefore enable significantly enhanced medical diagnosis. Approach: A comprehensive review of state-of-the-art accomplishments in OCT has been performed. Results: The most disruptive future OCT innovations include imaging resolution and speed (single-beam raster scanning versus parallelization) improvement, new implementations for dual modality or even multimodality systems, and using endogenous or exogenous contrast in these hybrid OCT systems targeting molecular and metabolic imaging. Aside from OCT angiography, no other functional or contrast enhancing OCT extension has accomplished comparable clinical and commercial impacts. Some more recently developed extensions, e.g., optical coherence elastography, dynamic contrast OCT, optoretinography, and artificial intelligence enhanced OCTare also considered with high potential for the future. In addition, OCT miniaturization for portable, compact, handheld, and/or cost-effective capsule-based OCT applications, home-OCT, and self- OCT systems based on micro-optic assemblies or photonic integrated circuits will revolutionize new applications and availability in the near future. Finally, clinical translation of OCT including medical device regulatory challenges will continue to be absolutely essential. Conclusions:With its exquisite non-invasive, micrometer resolution depth sectioning capability, OCT has especially revolutionized ophthalmic diagnosis and hence is the fastest adopted imaging technology in the history of ophthalmology. Nonetheless, OCT has not been completely exploited and has substantial growth potential-in academics as well as in industry. This applies not only to the ophthalmic application field, but also especially to the original motivation of OCT to enable optical biopsy, i.e., the in situ imaging of tissue microstructure with a resolution approaching that of histology but without the need for tissue excision. © 2021 SPIE.

Emerging technologies, changing organizational structures and dynamic work environments bring opportunities and pose new challenges to organizations. Such developments, together with the growing volume and variety of the exchanged data, mainly yield complexity. This complexity often represents a solid barrier to efficiency and impedes understanding, controlling, and improving processes in organizations. Hence, organizations are prevailingly seeking to identify and avoid unnecessary complexity, which is an odd mixture of different factors. Similarly, in research, much effort has been put into measuring, reviewing, and studying complexity. However, these efforts are highly fragmented and lack a joint perspective. Further, this negatively affects the complexity research acceptance by practitioners. In this study, we extend the body of knowledge on complexity research and practice addressing its high fragmentation. In particular, a comprehensive literature analysis of complexity research is conducted to capture different types of complexity in organizations. The results are comparatively analyzed, and a morphological box containing three aspects and ten features is developed. In addition, an established multi-dimensional complexity framework is employed to synthesize the results. Using the findings from these analyses and adopting the Goal Question Metric, we propose a method for complexity management. This method serves to provide key insights and decision support in the form of extensive guidelines for addressing complexity. Thus, our findings can assist organizations in their complexity management initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we adopt a Periodic Convolutional Recurrent Network (Periodic-CRN) model to employ the periodicity component in our proposals of the periodic representation dictionary (PRD). Phase shifts and non-stationarity of periodicity are the key components in the model to support. Specifically, we propose a Soft Periodic-CRN (SP-CRN) with three proposals of utilizing periodicity components: nearby-time (PRD-1), periodic-depth (PRD-2), and periodic-depth differencing (PRD-3) representation to improve climate forecasting accuracy. We experimented on geopotential height at 300 hPa (ZH300) and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets of ERA-Interim. The results showed the superiority of PRD-1 plus or minus one month of a prior cycle to capture the phase shift. In addition, PRD-3 considered only the depth of one differencing periodic cycle (i.e., the previous year) can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of ZH300 and SST. The mixed method of PRD-1, and PRD-3 (SP-CRN-1+3) showed a competitive or slight improvement over their base models. By adding the metadata component to indicate the month with one-hot encoding to SP-CRN-1+3, the prediction result was a drastic improvement. The results showed that the proposed method could learn four years of periodicity from the data, which may relate to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. © 2021 by the authors.

However, no study has attempted to illustrate the pattern and priorities of newspaper headlines in Bangladesh using a combination of text analytics techniques. The purpose of this paper is to examine the pattern of words that appeared on the front page of a well-known daily English newspaper in Bangladesh, The Daily Star, in 2018 and 2019. The elucidation of that era’s possible social and political context was also attempted using word patterns. The study employs three widely used and contemporary text mining techniques: word clouds, sentiment analysis, and cluster analysis. The word cloud reveals that election, kill, cricket, and Rohingya-related terms appeared more than 60 times in 2018, whereas BNP, poll, kill, AL, and Khaleda appeared more than 80 times in 2019. These indicated the country’s passion for cricket, political turmoil, and Rohingya-related issues. Furthermore, sentiment analysis reveals that words of fear and negative emotions appeared more than 600 times, whereas anger, anticipation, sadness, trust, and positive-type emotions came up more than 400 times in both years. Finally, the clustering method demonstrates that election, politics, deaths, digital security act, Rohingya, and cricket-related words exhibit similarity and belong to a similar group in 2019, whereas rape, deaths, road, and fire-related words clustered in 2018 alongside a similar-appearing group. In general, this analysis demonstrates how vividly the text mining approach depicts Bangladesh’s social, political, and law-and-order situation, particularly during election season and the country’s cricket craze, and also validates the significance of the text mining approach to understanding the overall view of a country during a particular time in an efficient manner. © 2021 by the authors.

Among these studies, it is worth highlighting the importance of those focused on the primary forms of prevention, such as social distancing, mask usage, quarantine, among others. This importance arises because, from the emergence of a new disease to the production of immunizers, preventive actions must be taken to reduce contamination and fatalities rates. Despite the considerable number of studies, no records of works aimed at the identification, registration, selection, and rigorous analysis and synthesis of the literature were found. For this purpose, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the application of technological solutions in the primary ways of respiratory infectious diseases transmission prevention. From the 1139 initially retrieved, 219 papers were selected for data extraction, analysis, and synthesis according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results enabled the identification of a general categorization of application domains, as well as mapping of the adopted support mechanisms. Findings showed a greater trend in studies related to pandemic planning and, among the support mechanisms adopted, data and mathematical application-related solutions received greater attention.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are believed to be a great solution to overcome this issue. EVs can reduce CO2 emissions because the vehicles use an electric motor as a propeller instead of an internal combustion engine. Combined with sustainable energy resources, EVs may become zero-emission transportation. This paper presents an overview of the EV drive train types, including their architecture with the benefits and drawbacks of each type. The aim is to summarize the recent progress of EV technology that always continues to be updated. Furthermore, a comparative investigation on energy density and efficiency, specific energy and power, cost, and application is carried out for batteries as the main energy storage. This discussion provides an understanding of the current development of battery technology, especially the batteries used in EVs. Moreover, the electric motor efficiency, power density, fault tolerance, reliability, and cost are also presented, including the most effective electric motor to use in EVs. The challenges and opportunities of EV deployment in the future are then discussed comprehensively. The government regulation for EVs is still a major non-technical challenge, whereas the charging time and battery performance are the challenges for the technical aspect. © 2021 by the authors.

In this environment, demand response programs and the intelligent management of energy consumption that are offered by utility providers will play a significant role in implementing smart energy. One of the approaches to implementing smart energy is to analyze consumption data and provide targeted contracts to consumers based on their individual consumption characteristics. To that end, the identification of individual consumption features is important for suppliers and utilities. Given the complexity of smart home load profiles, an appli-ance-based identification is nearly impossible. In this paper, we propose a different approach by grouping appliances based on their rooms; thus, we provide a room-based identification of energy consumption. To this end, this paper presents and tests an intelligent consumption identification methodology, that can be implemented in the form of an ensemble of artificial intelligence tools. The ensemble, which comprises four convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and four k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, is fed with smart submeter data and outputs the identified type of room in a given dwelling. Results obtained from real-world data exhibit the superiority of the ensemble, with respect to accuracy, as compared with individual CNN and KNN models. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, the nuances that define the realisation of BV from BI are still not understood by many organisations that have adopted BI. This paper aims to foster a deeper understanding of the relationship between Business Intelligence (BI) and business value (BV) by focusing on the theories that have been used, the critical factors of BV derivation, the inhibitors of BV, and the different forms of BV. To do this, a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology was adopted. Articles were retrieved from three scholarly databases, namely Google Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct, based on relevant search strings. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select ninety-three (93) papers as the primary studies. We found that the most used theoretical frameworks in studies on BI and BV are the Resource-Based View (RBV), Dynamic Capabilities Theory (DCT), Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE), and Contingency Theory (CON). The most acknowledged critical factors of BV are skilled human capital, BI Infrastructure, data quality, BI application and usage/data culture, BI alignment with organisational goals, and top management support. The most acclaimed inhibitors of BV are data quality and handling, data security and protection, lack of BI Infrastructure, and lack of skilled human resource capital, while customer intelligence is the most acknowledged form of BV. So far, many theories that are relevant to BI and BV, critical factors, inhibitors, and forms of BV were marginally mentioned in the literature, requiring more investigations. The study reveals opportunities for future research that can be explored to gain a deeper understanding of the issues of BV derivation from BI. It also offers useful insights for adopters of BI, BI researchers, and BI practitioners. © 2021 by the authors.

However, to achieve a sustainable energy supply, the energy planning approach needs to integrate some key dimensions. Importantly, these dimensions are necessary to guide the simulation and evaluation. It is against this backdrop that this paper focuses on the simulation and analysis approaches for sustainable planning, design, and development of microgrids based on clean energy resources. The paper first provides a comprehensive review of the existing simulation tools and approaches used for designing energy generation technologies. It then discusses and compares the traditional strategies and the emerging trends in energy systems simulation based on the software employed, the type of problem to be solved, input parameters provided, and the expected output. The paper introduces a practical simulation framework for sustainable energy planning, which is based on the social-technical-economic-environmental-policy (STEEP) model. The STEEP represents a holistic sustainability model that considers the key energy systems planning dimensions compared to the traditional techno-economic model used in several existing simulation tools and analyses.

However, previous studies on the prediction of polar vortex intensity are insufficient. This paper establishes a deep learning (DL) model for multi-day and long-time intensity prediction of the polar vortex. Focusing on the winter period with the strongest polar vortex intensity, geopotential height (GPH) data of NCEP from 1948 to 2020 at 50 hPa are used to construct the dataset of polar vortex anomaly distribution images and polar vortex intensity time series. Then, we propose a new convolution neural network with long short-term memory based on Gaussian smoothing (GSCNN-LSTM) model which can not only accurately predict the variation characteristics of polar vortex intensity from day to day, but also can produce a skillful forecast for lead times of up to 20 days. Moreover, the innovative GSCNN-LSTM model has better stability and skillful correlation prediction than the traditional and some advanced spatiotemporal sequence prediction models. The accuracy of the model suggests important implications that DL methods have good applicability in forecasting the nonlinear system and vortex spatial–temporal characteristics variation in the atmosphere. © 2021 by the authors.

The K-means clustering algorithm was used to analyze the regional characteristics of the dry hazard index (DHI) in China, and the impact of climate change on the variation trend and periodicity of regional drought in China was explored. The results show that the temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) of all clusters have an increasing trend under the two RCPs, and the precipitation of most clusters shows a significantly increasing trend. The drought index calcu-lated by the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is higher than those calcu-lated by the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized effective precipitation evapo-transpiration index (SP*ETI). The variation trends of drought intensity and frequency in China are not significant in the 21st century; however, the local variation trends are significant. The droughts in most parts of the Xinjiang Province, northern Tibet and western Qinghai Province show significantly increasing trends. According to the DHI analyses and the variations in the drought area ratio, with increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, the droughts in central and western China will become more severe, and drought will spread to the eastern areas of China. In the case that both precipitation and temperature may increase in the future, the increase in evapotranspiration caused by temperature rise will greatly affect drought dynamics.

Recent works on compact DCNNs as well as pruning methods are effective, yet with drawbacks. For instance, more than half the size of all MobileNet models lies in their last two layers, mainly because compact separable convolution (CONV) layers are not applicable to their last fully connected (FC) layers. Also, in pruning methods, the compression is gained at the expense of irregularity in the DCNN architecture, which necessitates additional indexing memory to address nonzero weights, thereby increasing memory footprint, decompression delays, and energy consumption. In this article, we propose cyclic sparsely connected (CSC) architectures, with memory/computation complexity of $\mathcal {O}(N\log {}N)$ , where $N$ is the number of nodes/channels given a DCNN layer that, contrary to compact depthwise separable layers, can be used as an overlay for both FC and CONV layers of $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$. Also, contrary to pruning methods, CSC architectures are structurally sparse and require no indexing due to their cyclic nature. We show that both standard convolution and depthwise convolution layers are special cases of the CSC layers, whose mathematical function, along with FC layers, can be unified into one single formulation and whose hardware implementation can be carried out under one arithmetic logic component. We examine the efficacy of the CSC architectures for compression of LeNet, AlexNet, and MobileNet DCNNs with precision ranging from 2 to 32 bits. More specifically, we surge upon the compact 8-bit quantized 0.5 MobileNet V1 and show that by compressing its last two layers with CSC architectures, the model is compressed by $\sim 1.5\times $ with a size of only 873 kB and little accuracy loss. Finally, we design a configurable hardware that implements all types of DCNN layers including FC, CONV, depthwise, CSC-FC, and CSC-CONV indistinguishably within a unified pipeline. We implement the hardware on a tiny Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for total on-chip processing of the compressed MobileNet that, compared to the related work, has the highest Inference/J while utilizing the smallest FPGA. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC); compressed deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs); cyclic sparsely connected (CSC) architectures; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); neural network accelerator,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116980413

In recent years, several countries have made huge investments in developing smart cities to offer sustainable living. However, there are some challenges to overcome in smart city development, such as traffic and transportation man-agement, energy and water distribution and management, air quality and waste management mon-itoring, etc. The capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help to achieve some goals of smart cities, and there are proven examples from some cities like Singapore, Copenhagen, etc. However, the adoption of AI and the IoT in developing countries has some chal-lenges. The analysis of challenges hindering the adoption of AI and the IoT are very limited. This study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the causal relationships among the challenges in smart city development, and contains several parts that conclude the previous scholars’ work, as well as independent research and investigation, such as data collection and analysis based on DE-MATEL. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to extract key challenges for the adoption of AI and the IoT. These helped us to proceed with the investigation and analyze the adoption status. Therefore, using the PRISMA method, 10 challenges were identified from the literature review. Sub-sequently, determination of the causal inter-relationships among the key challenges based on expert opinions using DEMATEL is performed. This study explored the driving and dependent power of the challenges, and causal relationships between the barriers were established. The results of the study indicated that “lack of infrastructure (C1)”, ”insufficient funds (C2)”, “cybersecurity risks (C3)”, and “lack of trust in AI, IoT” are the causal factors that are slowing down the adoption of AI and IoT in smart city development. The inter-relationships between the various challenges are pre-sented using a network relationship map, cause–effect diagram. The study’s findings can help regulatory bodies, policymakers, and researchers to make better decisions to overcome the challenges for developing sustainable smart cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Conventional Energy Storage System (ESS)-based DSM methods in South Korea are limited to real-time variability control owing to difficulties with model development using customers’ load profiles from sampling with higher temporal resolution. Herein, this study thus proposes a method of con-trolling the variability of customers’ load profiles for real-time DSM using customer-installed ESSs. To optimize the reserved capacity for the proposed maximum demand control within ESSs, this study also proposes a hybrid method of load generation, which synthesizes approaches based on Markov Transition Matrix (MTM) and Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) to estimate load variations every 15 min and, in turn reserve capacity in ESSs. The proposed ESS-based DSM strategy primarily reserves capacity in ESSs based on estimated variation in load, and performs real-time maximum demand control with the reserved capacity during scheduled peak shaving operations. To validate the proposed methods, this study used load profiles accumulated from industrial and general (i.e., commercial) customers under the time-of-use (TOU) rate. Simulation verified the improved performance of the proposed ESS-based DSM method for all customers, and results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K–S) testing indicate advances in the proposed hybrid estimation beyond the stand-alone estimation using the MTM-or ANN-based approach. © 2021 by the authors.

Extreme fluctuation in water levels in rivers, such as floods and droughts, are catastrophic in every manner; therefore, forecasting at an early stage would prevent possible disasters and relief efforts could be set up on time. This study aims to digitally model the water level in the Kabul River to prevent and alleviate the effects of any change in water level in this river downstream. This study used a machine learning tool known as the automatic autoregressive integrated moving average for statistical methodological analysis for forecasting the river flow. Based on the hydrological data collected from the water level of Kabul River in Swat, the water levels from 2011-2030 were forecasted, which were based on the lowest value of Akaike Information Criterion as 9.216. It was concluded that the water flow started to increase from the year 2011 till it reached its peak value in the year 2019-2020, and then the water level will maintain its maximum level to 250 cumecs and minimum level to 10 cumecs till 2030.

The aim of the study was to assess Polish women’s knowledge concerning GDM and their attitude to breastfeeding. As a research tool, an anonymous online survey that included 33 questions, grouped into three main sections—sociodemographic and obstetric variables, risk factors for GDM and neonatal adverse outcomes, and knowledge about breastfeeding—was used and administered online. A total of 410 women aged from 18 to 45 participated in this study. Based on the survey, it was demonstrated that the women had moderate knowledge concerning the maternal risk factors and adverse neonatal outcomes associated with GDM and, additionally, the short-and long-term effects of breastfeeding. Significantly deeper knowledge about GDM, including breastfeeding by GDM mothers, was observed among hyperglycemic mothers in comparison to normoglycemic mothers. However, knowledge concerning the health benefits of breastfeeding was not related to the mothers’ glycemic status. In conclusion, educational programs must include pre-pregnancy education of women and place emphasis on explaining the mechanism of development of GDM and the transformation of GDM to type 2 diabetes. This is crucial for changing the public’s perception of GDM as a temporary, reversible clinical entity. © 2021 by the authors.

This study revealed that the discrepancy between ratings by others and consumers’ post?purchasing evalua-tions significantly influenced both the valence and quantity of the reviews that consumers gener-ated. Specifically, a negative discrepancy (‘worse than what I read’) significantly accelerates consumers to write negative reviews (19/19 categories supported), while a positive discrepancy (‘better than what I read’) accelerates consumers to write positive reviews (16/19 categories supported). This implies that others’ ratings play an important role in influencing the review generation process by consumers. More interestingly, we found that this discrepancy significantly influences consumers’ neutral review generation, which is known to amplify the effect of positive or negative reviews by affecting consumers’ search behavior or the credibility of the information. However, this effect is asymmetric. While negative discrepancies lead consumers to write more neutral reviews, positive discrepancies help reduce neutral review generation. Furthermore, our findings provide important implications for marketers who tend to generate fake reviews or selectively generate reviews favor-able to their products to increase sales. Doing so may backfire on firms because negative discrepancies can accelerate the generation of objective or negative reviews. © 2021 by the authors.

We believe that the crisis is hastening nascent ESG trends, and that the increased focus on a company’s environmental and social impact will last long after crises have passed. We refined three fundamental concepts that guide our thinking on investing based on environmental, social, and governance factors as our approach to sustainable investing has evolved. The ESG factor assessments are more of an inherent aspect of a sound investment process than a separate investment discipline. When ESG variables are considered, the focus is on long-term risk adjusted investment returns. Investors should choose the strategy that best matches with their goals and interests. ESG investing is not a simple yes or no answer. The research gap extracted from the previous studies is to determine the relationship among the influencing factors of ESG and its priority with their driving and dependence capabilities. We used an ISM Approach to uncover the interrelationships and influencing behavior among the elements for considering ESG in investment after conducting a thorough literature research and consulting with experts. Here interpretive structural modeling (ISM) was used to explore the links among such extracted factors and its interdependencies. There was also focus on the short-term and long-term factors to achieve our desired objective. Our research will assist businesses in attracting and obtaining finance.

Financialization and cointegration place a premium on the accurate recognition of time-varying volatility in commodity markets, especially those for crude oil and refined fuels. This article seeks to identify critical periods in the trading of energyrelated commodities as a step toward understanding the temporal dynamics of those markets. This article proposes a novel application of unsupervised machine learning. A suite of clustering methods, applied to conditional volatility forecasts by trading days and individual assets or asset classes, can identify critical periods in energy-related commodity markets. Unsupervised machine learning achieves this task without rules-based or subjective definitions of crises. Five clustering methods— affinity propagation, mean-shift, spectral, k-means, and hierarchical agglomerative clustering—can identify anomalous periods in commodities trading. These methods identified the financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Applied to four energy-related markets— Brent, West Texas intermediate, gasoil, and gasoline—the same methods identified additional periods connected to events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and the 2003 Persian Gulf war. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding facilitates the visualization of trading regimes. Temporal clustering of conditional volatility forecasts reveals unusual financial properties that distinguish the trading of energy-related commodities during critical periods from trading during normal periods and from trade in other commodities in all periods. Whereas critical periods for all commodities appear to coincide with broader disruptions in demand for energy, critical periods unique to crude oil and refined fuels appear to arise from acute disruptions in supply. Extensions of these methods include the definition of bull and bear markets and the identification of recessions and recoveries in the real economy. © 2021 by the authors.

Encouraging to increase walking trips can bring various social and economic benefits to our society. Since the policy paradigm has been shifting from car-oriented to pedestrian-oriented, interest in securing pedestrian rights and improving walking environments is increasing significantly. This study aims to examine factors affecting pedestrian satisfaction according to land use and street type. A pedestrian satisfaction survey was conducted in an industrial city with a mid-size population in the city of Changwon, South Korea. Based on the survey data from 500 respondents, factors affecting pedestrian satisfaction were analyzed by land use (commercial or residential areas) and street type (non-separated or separated sidewalks). The analysis results, using binary and ordered logit models, showed that the less illegal parking, the more pedestrian space, pedestrian guidance facility, and green space, the higher the pedestrian satisfaction. Factors positively affecting the satisfaction of pedestrian paths according to land use were physical environmental variables, such as the separated sidewalk variable. In commercial areas, pedestrian guidance facilities and street cleanliness were included as major influencing factors, implying differences in land use influencing factors. A common factor affecting the satisfaction of separated or non-separated sidewalk cases was also identified as the sufficiency of walking space. Therefore, the most urgent policy measure for improving pedestrian satisfaction for the city was to install a sidewalk or expand the pedestrian space. In the pedestrian-vehicle separation models, green space and cleanliness were included as significant variables, and in the non-separated models, variables of pedestrian guidance facilities and sidewalk conditions were included. © 2021 by the authors.

First, a questionnaire-based survey consisting of a five-point Likert scale was conducted. A total of 416 respondents provided their complete responses. Then, we employed the structural equation modeling (SEM) model using AMOS 24 to empirically test the hypothesized model. The empirical results revealed that price and attractiveness positively influence mobile phone buying behavior among young adults in Pakistan. On the other hand, Service Encounter, Convenience, Avoidance of Core Service Failure, and Response have negative but statistically insignificant influences on mobile phone buying behavior in Pakistan. This finding revealed that the mobile shopping behavior of young Pakistani adults is predominantly influenced by the price of mobile phones and their attractiveness. Therefore, it is highly recommended that companies need to offer affordable mobile phone prices.

Speech interfaces, represented by speech synthesis and speech recognition, can be used to transcribe medical documents, control medical devices, correct speech and hearing impairments, and assist the visually impaired. However, it is essential to predict prosody phrase boundaries for accurate natural speech synthesis. This study proposes a method to build a reliable learning corpus to train prosody boundary prediction models based on deep learning. In addition, we offer a way to generate a rule-based model that can predict the prosody boundary from the constructed corpus and use the result to train a deep learning-based model. As a result, we have built a coherent corpus, even though many workers have participated in its development. The estimated pairwise agreement of corpus annotations is between 0.7477 and 0.7916 and kappa coefficient (K) between 0.7057 and 0.7569. In addition, the deep learning-based model based on the rules obtained from the corpus showed a prediction accuracy of 78.57% for the three-level prosody phrase boundary, 87.33% for the two-level prosody phrase boundary. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, this research investigates and analyzes the performance of different optimization methods in the train-ing phase of artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the accuracy enhancement of EPF. In this work, a multi-objective optimization-based feature selection technique with the capability of eliminating non-linear and interacting features is imple-mented to create an efficient day-ahead price forecasting. In the beginning, the multi-objective binary backtracking search algorithm (MOBBSA)-based feature selection technique is used to exam-ine various combinations of input variables to choose the suitable feature subsets, which minimizes, simultaneously, both the number of features and the estimation error. In the later phase, the selected features are transferred into the machine learning-based techniques to map the input variables to the output in order to forecast the electricity price. Furthermore, to increase the forecasting accuracy, a backtracking search algorithm (BSA) is applied as an efficient evolutionary search algorithm in the learning procedure of the ANFIS approach. The performance of the forecasting methods for the Queensland power market in the year 2018, which is well-known as the most competitive market in the world, is investigated and compared to show the superiority of the proposed methods over other selected methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, among Southern researchers, a few significantly outperform their peers and can be styled research “positive deviants” (PDs). In this paper we ask: who are those PDs, what are their characteristics and how are they able to overcome some of the challenges facing researchers in the global South? We examined a sample of 203 information systems researchers in Egypt who were classified into PDs and non-PDs (NPDs) through an analysis of their publication and citation data. Based on six citation metrics, we were able to identify and group 26 PDs. We then analysed their attributes, attitudes, practices, and publications using a mixed-methods approach involving interviews, a survey and analysis of publication-related datasets. Two predictive models were developed using partial least squares regression; the first predicted if a researcher is a PD or not using individual-level predictors and the second predicted if a paper is a paper of a PD or not using publication-level predictors. PDs represented 13% of the researchers but produced about half of all publications, and had almost double the citations of the overall NPD group. At the individual level, there were significant differences between both groups with regard to research collaborations, capacity development, and research directions. At the publication level, there were differences relating to the topics pursued, publication outlets targeted, and paper features such as length of abstract and number of authors. © 2021, The Author(s).",Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Global South; High-performing researchers; Higher education policy; Mixed-methods; Positive deviance; Topic modelling,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114779407

Data were collected from 2015 to 2019 using participatory observation, engaging in meetings of key players; in-depth interviews with key heads of relevant agencies, officials, and NGOs; and a questionnaire for Social Network Analysis. The results show that there are seven influential institutions for addressing land and forest fires in Riau. However, the power of the decision-making process is concentrated at the level of the President and the Governor as the regional leader, which implies that large institutions involved in fire response have less power and responsibility owing in part to bureaucratic inertia as bureaucracy is overly centralised and less responsive. In the long term, devolution of government authority from the central to the local level is required to furnish front-line institutions with the power to deal with the fires. © 2021 Journal Compilation",bureaucratic inertia; collaboration; coordination; forest fire; Indonesia,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113245266

For efficiently processing these computational- and memory-intensive applications, tensors of these overparameterized models are compressed by leveraging sparsity, size reduction, and quantization of tensors. Unstructured sparsity and tensors with varying dimensions yield irregular computation, communication, and memory access patterns; processing them on hardware accelerators in a conventional manner does not inherently leverage acceleration opportunities. This article provides a comprehensive survey on the efficient execution of sparse and irregular tensor computations of ML models on hardware accelerators. In particular, it discusses enhancement modules in the architecture design and the software support, categorizes different hardware designs and acceleration techniques, analyzes them in terms of hardware and execution costs, analyzes achievable accelerations for recent DNNs, and highlights further opportunities in terms of hardware/software/model codesign optimizations (inter/intramodule). The takeaways from this article include the following: understanding the key challenges in accelerating sparse, irregular shaped, and quantized tensors; understanding enhancements in accelerator systems for supporting their efficient computations; analyzing tradeoffs in opting for a specific design choice for encoding, storing, extracting, communicating, computing, and load-balancing the nonzeros; understanding how structured sparsity can improve storage efficiency and balance computations; understanding how to compile and map models with sparse tensors on the accelerators; and understanding recent design trends for efficient accelerations and further opportunities. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Compact models; compiler optimizations; dataflow; deep learning; deep neural networks (DNNs); dimension reduction; energy efficiency; hardware/software/model codesign; machine learning (ML); pruning; quantization; reconfigurable computing; sparsity; spatial architecture; tensor decomposition; VLSI,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112154428

In particular, 5G networks need to support three typical usage scenarios, namely, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). On the one hand, UAVs can be leveraged as cost-effective aerial platforms to provide ground users with enhanced communication services by exploiting their high cruising altitude and controllable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space. On the other hand, providing such communication services simultaneously for both UAV and ground users poses new challenges due to the need for ubiquitous 3D signal coverage as well as the strong air-ground network interference. Besides the requirement of high-performance wireless communications, the ability to support effective and efficient sensing as well as network intelligence is also essential for 5G-and-beyond 3D heterogeneous wireless networks with coexisting aerial and ground users.

Due to the complexity of human activities, most researches are limited to climate change, whereas the response analysis of human activities to changes in biophysical parameters are still lacking or not comprehensively considered. Therefore, large biases and uncertainties still exist in the estimates of regional responses to global change. Firstly, we specifically quantified the main human activities related to land use/land cover change (LULCC) in the northern Tianshan Mountains (NTM), and identified the spatiotemporal changes of primary biophysical parameters, including Albedo, leaf area index (LAI), land surface temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Then, we tested the performance of the five models used, including multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). RF outperformed others and was used to quantify and disaggregate the contribution of climate change and human activities to land surface parameters in the NTM. We found a strong spatial heterogeneity in the spatial variation of all biophysical parameters. Except for LST, the annual maximum Albedo, LAI, and NDVI showed a significant increasing trend in the NTM from 2000 to 2019 (p < 0.05). Generally, climate change contributed more to the biophysical parameters than human activities. However, the contribution of human activities to NDVI was 0.51, which was greater than that of climate change during 2000–2015. This study provides new insight on the impact of climate change and human activities on biophysical parameters and a scientific basis for model parameterization in the arid region. © 2021 The Authors",Biophysical parameters; Climate change; Human activities; Machine learning; Random Forest model; The Northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110500986

Part of the challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent academic findings and research into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential factors are similar. Top management support, policy and procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations, with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a robust security culture.

In 1990–2005, the area of desertified land increased significantly, afterward, a decreasing trend was observed. Lightly and moderately desertified lands had the highest change intensities and were most sensitive to environmental factors. Although the desertification dynamics are under the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors, precipitation plays a dominant role in Mongolia. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the desertification status and trends in Mongolia, and presents desertification maps that can be used to formulate preventive measures and guide desertification prevention and control. © 2021 The Authors",Desertification dynamics; Desertification maps; GEE; Gravity center change; Intensity analysis; Machine learning methods; Mongolia,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108358308

The ongoing pandemic is a global public health concern due to its sagacious impacts on environmental sustainability, social responsibility and people’s quality of life. This study primarily focuses on analysing the impact of COVID-19 (COV) on the environmental awareness (EA), sustainable consumption (SC) and social responsibility (SR). Additionally, we aspire to investigate the impact of demographics of generations and religion on the proposed nexus in this study. The data was collected from 700 participants of different age groups and religious backgrounds in Malaysia, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse this data and test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that COVID-19 has a significantly positive impact on EA, SC and SR, and the generations and religiosity moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and its impact on sustainable behaviours. This study contributes to analyse the difference in the perception of EA, SC and SR among the people that eventually will stimulate the scientific reasoning among the governments, policymakers and scientists to develop a holistic framework to combat unprecedented event such as COVID-19 and ensure the authentication of sustainable environment and exceptional quality of life. The policymakers in Malaysia may use the findings of this study to inspect the social and environmental aspects of the people during the transformation events. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19; Environmental awareness; Malaysia; Pandemic; Social responsibility; Sustainable consumption,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106710788

This paper studies the energy scheduling of integrated electrical and gas energy system with bi-directional energy conversion at distribution network level, considering wind power uncertainty. To realize independent autonomy of energy networks, meantime adjusting scheduling strategies of integrated energy system from system-level perspective, innovative edge-cloud collaborative operation architecture is proposed. In edge servers, electrical and gas networks are optimized severally for scheduling strategies. In cloud server, the uncertainty of wind power are processed with robust optimization method, strategies of energy conversion units are updated for re-optimization. Cooperated with edge-cloud architecture, a novel multi-time scales rolling optimization framework is proposed, electrical and gas networks are optimized under day-ahead time scale in corresponding edge servers, and electrical network is further adjusted under intraday time scale in electrical edge server. Case studies show that edge-cloud collaborative operation architecture can ensure the practical feasibility of optimization, which is more suitable for energy scheduling of integrated electrical and gas energy system.

Different spatial (i.e., Spatial Lag and Spatial Error Model) and non-spatial (Classic Model) regression techniques were employed in the research to detect the geographical relevance of potential risk factors affecting the transmission of COVID-19. Results indicate that population density was crucial for explaining the pattern of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh.

However, sensor nodes in IoT suffer from the limited lifetime of batteries resulting from their finite energy availability. A promising solution is to harvest energy from environmental sources, such as solar, kinetic, thermal, and radio-frequency (RF) waves, for perpetual and continuous operation of IoT sensor nodes. In addition to energy generation, recently energy harvesters have been used for context detection, eliminating the need for conventional activity sensors (e.g., accelerometers), saving space, cost, and energy consumption. Using energy harvesters for simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting enables energy positive sensing - an important and emerging class of sensors, which harvest more energy than required for context detection and the additional energy can be used to power other components of the system. Although simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting is an important step forward toward autonomous self-powered sensor nodes, the energy and information availability can be still intermittent, unpredictable, and temporally misaligned with various computational tasks on the sensor node. This article provides a comprehensive survey on task scheduling algorithms for the emerging class of energy harvesting-based sensors (i.e., energy positive sensors) to achieve the sustainable operation of IoT. We discuss inherent differences between conventional sensing and energy positive sensing and provide an extensive critical analysis for devising revised task scheduling algorithms incorporating this new class of sensors. Finally, we outline future research directions toward the implementation of autonomous and self-powered IoT. © 2014 IEEE.",Energy harvesting; energy prediction; Internet of Things (IoT); sensing; task scheduling; ubiquitous computing; wearables,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107371446

Effective priority setting is required to maximise the impact of limited budgets. The Optima TB tool has been developed to support analytical capacity and inform evidence-based priority setting processes for TB health benefits package design. This paper outlines the Optima TB framework and how it was applied in Belarus, an upper-middle income country in Eastern Europe with a relatively high burden of TB. Optima TB is a population-based disease transmission model, with programmatic cost functions and an optimisation algorithm. Modelled populations include age-differentiated general populations and higher-risk populations such as people living with HIV. Populations and prospective interventions are defined in consultation with local stakeholders. In partnership with the latter, demographic, epidemiological, programmatic, as well as cost and spending data for these populations and interventions are then collated. An optimisation analysis of TB spending was conducted in Belarus, using program objectives and constraints defined in collaboration with local stakeholders, which included experts, decision makers, funders and organisations involved in service delivery, support and technical assistance. These analyses show that it is possible to improve health impact by redistributing current TB spending in Belarus. Specifically, shifting funding from inpatient- to outpatient-focused care models, and from mass screening to active case finding strategies, could reduce TB prevalence and mortality by up to 45% and 50%, respectively, by 2035. In addition, an optimised allocation of TB spending could lead to a reduction in drug-resistant TB infections by 40% over this period. This would support progress towards national TB targets without additional financial resources. The case study in Belarus demonstrates how reallocations of spending across existing and new interventions could have a substantial impact on TB outcomes. This highlights the potential for Optima TB and similar modelling tools to support evidence-based priority setting. © 2021 Goscé et al.

Based on the reports published, the number of closed entrepreneurs are significantly more than the number of those newly established. These statistics also reflect that the development of entrepreneurship faces several challenges. However, a strategic management program must be accurately conducted to effectively control entrepreneurial challenges based on the limitation of time and financial resources. On the other hand, the program should provide an appropriate opportunity for competitiveness by producing better quality goods and services successfully marketed to consumers. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust model with a high potential for evaluation of entrepreneurial challenges in order to identify and control the most critical ones. To achieve the aim, the most critical parameters should be identified to prevent wasting the resources. Likewise, the analytical network process (ANP) method, a branch of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, is a powerful tool that can consider all interrelationships and interdependencies between criteria. On the other hand, neutrosophic sets are among the most widespread approaches in coping with vagueness and unknown environment. The methodology employed in this paper uses a combination model based on ANP and neutrosophic sets using sustainable development indicators to prioritize the challenges of entrepreneurship.

Currently, the existing recommendation algorithms encounter certain problems when making decisions regarding tourist attractions and tour routes. This paper presents a smart tourism recommendation algorithm based on a cellular geospatial clustering and weighted collaborative filtering. The problems are analyzed and concluded, and then the research ideas and methods to solve the problems are introduced. Aimed at solving the problems, the tourist attraction recommendation model is set up based on a cellular geographic space generating model and a weighted collaborative filtering model. According to the matching degree between the tourists’ interest needs and tourist attraction feature attributes, a precise tourist attraction recommendation is obtained. In combination with the geospatial attributes of the tourist destination, the spatial adjacency clustering model based on the cellular space generating algorithm is set up, and then the weighted model is introduced for the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, which ensures that the recommendation result precisely matches the tourists’ needs. Providing precise results, the optimal tour route recommendation model based on the precise tourist attraction approach vector algorithm is set up. The approach vector algorithm is used to search the optimal route between two POIs under the condition of multivariate traffic modes to provide the tourists with the best motive benefits. To verify the feasibility and advantages of the algorithm, this paper designs a sample experiment and analyzes the resulting data to obtain the relevant conclusion. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: The data period covered the years 2011–2018; the data set consists of 176 MFIs from six Asian countries. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach was employed to examine the MFIs’ efficiency levels. Generalised Least Square (GLS) regressions were used to analyse the impacts of social globalisation and other determinants towards the efficiency of MFIs. Findings and value added: Interpersonal globalisation had a significantly negative correlation with social efficiency, suggesting that increasing the number of foreigners in management intrudes on local managers’ decisions. Informational globalisation had a significantly positive correlation with financial and social efficiency, which signifies that more information produces monopolistic profits in this industry. Finally, cultural globalisation had a positive correlation with social efficiency, demonstrating that a global trading culture improves the abilities and technological skills for labour development and enhances MFIs’ social efficiency. In general, the Cobb Douglas Production theory explained the understanding of the impacts social globalisation has on MFI efficiency. Furthermore, the findings from this study could provide important scientific, practical gap and contribute new insights and implications to various parties. Firstly, governments or policymakers can establish effective national policies and strategies. Secondly, this study could support investors in monitoring and understanding the performance of MFIs. Finally, the research could fill scholarly gaps and uncover more potential factors that influence the efficiency of MFIs. Copyright © Instytut Bada?

Although rainfall is highly correlated with mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in humans, less research focuses on understanding the impact of flooding events on disease incidence. This lack of research presents a significant gap in climate change–driven disease forecasting. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a scoping review to assess the strength of evidence regarding the potential relationship between flooding and MBD and to determine knowledge gaps. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through 31 December 2020 and supplemented with review of citations in relevant publications. Studies on rainfall were included only if the operationalization allowed for distinction of unusually heavy rainfall events. Data were abstracted by disease (dengue, malaria, or other) and stratified by post-event timing of disease assessment. Studies that conducted statistical testing were summarized in detail. RESULTS: From 3,008 initial results, we included 131 relevant studies (dengue n = 45, malaria n = 61, other MBD n = 49). Dengue studies indicated short-term (<1 month) decreases and subsequent (1–4 month) increases in incidence. Malaria studies indicated post-event incidence increases, but the results were mixed, and the temporal pattern was less clear. Statistical evidence was limited for other MBD, though findings suggest that human outbreaks of Murray Valley encephalitis, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis may follow flooding. DISCUSSION: Flooding is generally associated with increased incidence of MBD, potentially following a brief decrease in incidence for some diseases. Methodological inconsistencies significantly limit direct comparison and generalizability of study results. Regions with established MBD and weather surveillance should be leveraged to conduct multisite research to a) standardize the quantification of relevant flooding, b) study nonlinear relationships between rainfall and disease, c) report outcomes at multiple lag periods, and d) investigate interacting factors that modify the likelihood and severity of outbreaks across different settings. © 2021, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

To achieve satisfactory performance and quality of service, selecting the most suitable resources (SMDs) is crucial. The selection is generally made based on the computing capability of an SMD, which is defined by its various fixed and variable resource parameters. As the selection is made on different criteria of varying significance, the resource selection problem can be duly represented as an MCDM problem. However, for the real-time implementation of MCC and considering its dynamicity, the resource selection algorithm should be time-efficient. In this paper, we aim to find out a suitable MCDM method for resource selection in such a dynamic and time-constraint environment. For this, we present a comparative analysis of various MCDM methods under asymmetric conditions with varying selection criteria and alternative sets. Various datasets of different sizes are used for evaluation. We execute each program on a Windows-based laptop and also on an Android-based smartphone to assess average runtimes. Besides time complexity analysis, we perform sensitivity analysis and ranking order comparison to check the correctness, stability, and reliability of the rankings generated by each method. © 2021 by the authors.

With a rising interest of scholars in the smart city phenomenon, the role entrepreneurship plays in the development of smart cities became a central topic in academia. However, there is a lack of discussion concerning the specific settings and characteristics of digital entrepreneurship in the smart city scenario. Nowadays, the concept of digital entrepreneurship is considered as a part of the digital entrepreneurial ecosystems (DEE) that provides an environment for effective entrepreneurial activities. Hence, the investigation on how DEE is interconnected with smart cities and how they both can contribute to their mutual development appears both timely and necessary. To reach this research objective, the authors, after giving a clear definition of each component of DEE based on an extensive literature review, consider its interconnection with the smart city model. The connection between the dimensions of a smart city and the structural constituents of DEE is also tracked, highlighting the contribution of each element to the development of a smart city. Through the creation of a comprehensive framework, the results of the paper show clearly that DEE is an inevitable part of a smart city environment. The research also covers the model of DEE engagement in smart city architecture. © 2021 by the authors.

Many investigations have been carried for the biodiversity, hydrological indicators, and species distribution along Yangtze River caused by dam construction. As a result, the ecological operation has been gradually applied to mitigate the negative effects of water conservancy projects. In order to well know recent advances in the study of fish habitat in the Yangtze River Basin, 424 original papers published from 2000 to 2020 using bibliometrics were compiled in this research to analyze the developing trends including topics, data, and research status. The results of literature statistics showed that the related research fields on the effects of the reservoir on hydrological indicators mainly focused on negative impact caused by hydrological changes, water temperature effect, and sediment variation.

The world economy has declined due to purchasing power for individuals who have been forced to stay at home and cannot perform work. These restrictions to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov-2 have led to an increase in electronic commerce and mobile commerce as tools for procuring goods and services. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of mobile commerce as an essential electronic commerce component, establishing the main drivers of mobile commerce and the intensity of their influences. The research focuses on mobile commerce in the United States (U.S.). It covers the period 2010-2020, the last year of this period capturing the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile commerce (m-commerce). In the macroeconomic analysis of competitiveness, we established the main drivers of m-commerce, using artificial neural networks and the mediation effects found between the variables that describe m-commerce, e-commerce, and total sales, using structural equation modeling. The research results indicate an increase in the share of e-commerce in total sales and a predominance of the m-commerce share in e-commerce on the background of traffic restrictions and social distance rules imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A desirable urban environment can make people feel at ease and comfortable and contribute to promoting positive public emotions. However, in the process of rapid urban development, the high-density and overloaded urban built environment has triggered people’s mental tension and anxiety and has contributed to negative emotions. Thus, this study aimed to explore the spatial distribution of public emotions and urban built environments in cities and to thoroughly investigate the correlation between urban built environments and public emotions. Considering the lack of dynamic elements analysis and emotions spatial analysis in previous studies, this study takes Wuhan City as an example, uses social media big data as the basis for text emotion analysis, introduces dynamic traffic elements, and establishes a multidimensional urban built environment measurement index system from five aspects: land use, spatial form, road and traffic, green space and open space, and daily life service facilities. Subsequently, the spatial distribution characteristics of public sentiment and urban built environment elements in Wuhan were analyzed. Finally, a geographically weighted regression method was used to analyze the degree of influence of different urban built environment elements on public emotions. The results showed that public emotions in Wuhan are not homogeneously distributed in terms of score and space and that there are significant differences. The urban built environment has a significant influence on public emotions. Higher land use mix, higher road network density, higher number of public transportation facilities, higher number of public open spaces, lower traffic congestion, and impact of freight transportation play important roles in promoting positive emotions. Therefore, in the process of urban construction, planners and decision makers should purposefully improve the quality of the built environment. Measures can include improving the mix of land functions, alleviating traffic congestion, avoiding the negative effects of freight traffic, rationally constructing green and open spaces, and improving various living facilities. This can help contribute toward improving urban functions and urban environments, and promote the construction of a people-oriented healthy city. © 2021 by the authors.

Three distinct themes are inspected and interrelated to develop awareness for an urbanizing world: Internal urban design and innovation, technical transition, and geopolitical change. Data were collected on the use of energy in cities and, by extension, nation states over the last 30 years. The urban population boom continues to pressure the energy dimension with heavily weighted impacts on less developed regions. Sustainable urban energy will need to reduce resource inputs and environmental impacts and decouple economic growth from energy consumption. Fossil fuels continue to be the preferred method of energy for cities; however, an increased understanding is emerging that sustainable energy forms can be implemented as alternatives. Key to this transition will be the will to invest in renewables (i.e., solar, wind, hydro, tidal, geothermal, and biomass), efficient infrastructure, and smart eco-city designs. This essay elucidates how the technical transition of energy-friendly technologies focuses on understanding the changes in the energy mix from non-renewable to renewable. Smart electricity storage grids with artificial intelligence can operate internationally and alleviate some geopolitical barriers. Energy politics is shown to be a problematic hurdle with case research examples specific to Central and Eastern Europe. The energy re-shift stressed is a philosophical re-thinking of modern cities as well as a new approach to the humanenergy relationship. © 2021 by the authors.

Drought forecasting is critical for water resource development and management as it helps to reduce negative consequences. In this study, scientometric analysis and manual comprehensive analysis on drought modelling and forecasting are used. A scientometric analysis is used to determine the current research trend using bibliometric data and to identify relevant publication field sources with the most publications, the most frequently used keywords, the most cited articles and authors, and the countries that have made the greatest contributions to the field of water resources. This paper also tries to provide an overview of water issues, such as drought classification, drought indices, historical droughts, and their impact on Asian countries such as China, Pakistan, India, and Iran. There have been many models established for this purpose and choosing the appropriate model for study is a long procedure for researchers. An appropriate, comprehensive, pedagogical study of model ideas and historical implementations would benefit researchers by helping them to avoid overlooking viable model options, thus reducing their time spent on the topic. As a result, the goal of this paper is to review drought-forecasting approaches and recommend the best models for the Asian region. The models are divided into four categories based on their mechanisms: Regression analysis, stochastic modelling, machine learning, and dynamic modelling. The basic concepts of each approach in terms of the model’s historical use, benefits, and limitations are explained.

The results show that there are great regional differences in high-quality economic development, high-quality logistics development and their coupling coordination degree in China. In the areas with high-quality economic development, the logistics industry is not necessarily high quality, and the coupling coordination degree between the logistics industry and high-quality economic development is generally not high. The main reason for this is that the coordination between the logistics industry and high-quality economic development is poor.

Today, studies involving the geographical source, flow path, and transit/residence time of streamflow components have enhanced our understanding of the hydrological processes by using hydrometeorological measurements, water chemistry, and stable isotope approaches. In the future, new methods, such as path analysis and ensemble hydrograph separation, should be verified and used in more regions, especially in remote and mountainous areas. Additionally, the understanding of the role of surface water in streamflow components remains limited and should be deeply studied in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on existing approaches on the architecture of SMESs, this paper develops a sample architecture grounded in the current controlling structure of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While only a few papers on approaches to the given topic exist, this approach makes use of operative production controlling data and uses a standardisation module to provide standardised data. The sample architecture was validated with a case study on a Czech SME. This case study was conducted on two different entities of one production company suggesting differences in the entities due to the nature of production. The research showed that simple tasks with intelligent welding equipment allow for a working SMES architecture, while complex assembly works with a high extent of human labour, and a high number of components still remain an obstacle. This research contributes to gathering more understanding of SMES architectures in SMEs by making use of a standardisation module. © 2021 by the author.

However, significant data and evidence gaps remain. Lack of resources, limited capacity within governments and logistical difficulties in collecting data are some of the reasons for the data gaps. Big data—that is digitally generated, passively produced and automatically collected—offers a great potential for answering some of the data needs. Satellite and sensors, mobile phone call detail records, online transactions and search data, and social media are some of the examples of big data. Integrating big data with the traditional household surveys and administrative data can complement data availability, quality, granularity, accuracy and frequency, and help measure development outcomes temporally and spatially in a number of new ways.The study maps different sources of big data onto development outcomes (based on SDGs) to identify current evidence base, use and the gaps. The map provides a visual overview of existing and ongoing studies. This study also discusses the risks, biases and ethical challenges in using big data for measuring and evaluating development outcomes. The study is a valuable resource for evaluators, researchers, funders, policymakers and practitioners in their effort to contributing to evidence informed policy making and in achieving the SDGs. Objectives: Identify and appraise rigorous impact evaluations (IEs), systematic reviews and the studies that have innovatively used big data to measure any development outcomes with special reference to difficult contexts. Search Methods: A number of general and specialised data bases and reporsitories of organisations were searched using keywords related to big data by an information specialist. Selection Criteria: The studies were selected on basis of whether they used big data sources to measure or evaluate development outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection was conducted using a data extraction tool and all extracted data was entered into excel and then analysed using Stata. The data analysis involved looking at trends and descriptive statistics only. Main Results: The search yielded over 17,000 records, which we then screened down to 437 studies which became the foundation of our systematic map. We found that overall, there is a sizable and rapidly growing number of measurement studies using big data but a much smaller number of IEs. We also see that the bulk of the big data sources are machine-generated (mostly satellites) represented in the light blue. We find that satellite data was used in over 70% of the measurement studies and in over 80% of the IEs. Authors' Conclusions: This map gives us a sense that there is a lot of work being done to develop appropriate measures using big data which could subsequently be used in IEs. Information on costs, ethics, transparency is lacking in the studies and more work is needed in this area to understand the efficacies related to the use of big data. There are a number of outcomes which are not being studied using big data, either due to the lack to applicability such as education or due to lack of awareness about the new methods and data sources. The map points to a number of gaps as well as opportunities where future researchers can conduct research. © 2021 The Authors.

To evaluate the effectiveness of spatial-temporal dependence forecasting, the basic time series forecasting models for use in our comparison were first built based on an autoregression integrated moving average model (ARIMA), a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression (SVR). Subsequently, combining a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) with SVR, an SVR- GBDT model for spatial-temporal dependence forecast was constructed. The SVR model was only used to build a spatial-temporal dependence forecasting model, which does not distinguish spatial and temporal information but instead takes them as data features. Taking inland ports in the Yangtze River as an example, the results indicated that the ports’ weekly freight volumes had a higher autocorrelation with the previous 1–3 weeks, and the Pearson correlation values of the ports’ weekly cargo volume were mainly located in the interval (0.2–0.5). In addition, the weekly freight volumes of the inland ports were higher depending on their past data, and the spatial-temporal dependence model improved the performance of the weekly freight volume forecasts for the inland river. This study may help to (1) reveal the significance of spatial correlation factors in ports’ short-term freight volume predictions, (2) develop prediction models for inland ports, and (3) improve the planning and operation of port entities. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of the current study is to examine green consumption intention in the hospitality and tourism industry as an outcome of green supply chain management and strategic green marketing orientation. It also aims to investigate the green brand image and green social responsibility in a mediated-moderation mechanism to induce green consumption. Based on the deductive approach, and cross-sectional quantitative data of 317 hotel visitors/guests in the northern tourism hotspots in Pakistan, the hypothesized relationships were tested through the structural equation modeling technique with partial least squares. The findings empirically establish that green supply chain management and strategic green marketing orientation have positive and significant effects on green consumption intention. Further, environmental concern (i.e., green image) partially mediates the relationship between strategic green marketing orientation, green supply chain management, and green consumption behavior. The results also revealed that brand social responsibility does not moderate green image and green consumption behavior. These stimulating new findings guided by the signaling theory, provide strategic insights that help to upgrade the tourism supply chains and enabling them to become green. © 2021 by the authors.

The results demonstrate that individuals’ threat appraisal (perceived severity and perceived vulnerabil-ity) and intrinsic motivation (perceived autonomy and perceived relatedness) are negatively associated with interdependence. Additionally, interdependence within the online knowledge community is proved to negatively affect individuals’ knowledge hiding intention.

Therefore, cities should be prepared to satisfy the needs of their citizens and provide the best services. The idea of a city of the future is commonly represented by the smart city, which is a more efficient system that optimizes its resources and services, through the use of monitoring and communication technology. Thus, one of the steps towards sustainability for cities around the world is to make a transition into smart cities. Here, sensors play an important role in the system, as they gather relevant information from the city, citizens, and the corresponding communication networks that transfer the information in real-time. Although the use of these sensors is diverse, their application can be categorized in six different groups: energy, health, mobility, security, water, and waste management. Based on these groups, this review presents an analysis of different sensors that are typically used in efforts toward creating smart cities. Insights about different applications and communication systems are provided, as well as the main opportunities and challenges faced when making a transition to a smart city. Ultimately, this process is not only about smart urban infrastructure, but more importantly about how these new sensing capabilities and digitization developments improve quality of life. Smarter communities are those that socialize, adapt, and invest through transparent and inclusive community engagement in these technologies based on local and regional societal needs and values.

Thus, it was deemed significant to identify e-learning motivating factors related to mental health. Furthermore, because computer programming skills are among the core competencies that professionals are expected to possess in the era of rapid technology devel-opment, it was also considered important to identify the factors relating to computer programming learning. Thus, this study applied the Learning Motivating Factors Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) instruments. The sample consisted of 444 e-learners, including 189 computer programming e-learners. The results revealed that higher scores of individual attitude and expectation, challenging goals, clear direction, social pressure, and competition significantly varied across depression categories. The scores of challenging goals, and social pressure and competition, significantly varied across anxiety categories. The scores of individual attitude and expectation, challenging goals, and social pressure and competition significantly varied across general fatigue categories. In the group of computer programming e-learners: challenging goals predicted decreased anxiety; clear direction and challenging goals predicted decreased de-pression; individual attitude and expectation predicted diminished general fatigue; and challenging goals and punishment predicted diminished mental fatigue. Challenging goals statistically significantly predicted lower mental fatigue, and mental fatigue statistically significantly predicted depression and anxiety in both sample groups. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to maintain local area energy balance and reliability, microgrids (MG) are proposed. Microgrids are low or medium voltage distribution systems with a resilient operation, that control the exchange of power between the main grid, locally distributed generators (DGs), and consumers using intelligent energy management techniques. This paper gives a brief introduction to microgrids, their operations, and further, a review of different energy management approaches. In a microgrid control strategy, an energy management system (EMS) is the key component to maintain the balance between energy resources (CG, DG, ESS, and EVs) and loads available while contributing the profit to utility.

This study estimates daily potential ET (PET) in real-time for the Korean Peninsula, via an artificial neural network (ANN), using data from the GEO? KOMPSAT 2A satellite, which is equipped with an Advanced Meteorological Imager (GK2A/AMI). We also used passive microwave data, numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data, and static data. The ANN?based PET model was trained using data for the period 25 July 2019 to 24 July 2020, and was tested by comparing with in?situ PET for the period 25 July 2020 to 31 July 2021. In terms of accuracy, the PET model performed well, with root?mean?square error (RMSE), bias, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) of 0.649 mm day?1, ?0.134 mm day?1, and 0.954, respectively. To examine the efficiency of the GK2A/AMI?derived PET data, we compared it with in?situ ET measured at flux towers and with MODIS PET data. The accuracy of the GK2A/AMI?derived PET, in comparison with the flux tower?measured ET, showed RMSE, bias, and Pearson’s R of 1.730 mm day?1, 1.212 mm day?1, and 0.809, respectively.

In this regard, understanding which resources are influential in market entry decisions is crucial given that there are different resource needs between developed (DMNE) and emerging market (EMNE) multinationals. Answering calls for more neo-configurational studies in the literature, our study uses a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach to examine foreign multinational entry decisions in 51 regions of the U.S. We constructed a novel dataset comprised of 3287 foreign firms from 61 countries and territories operating in the biopharmaceutical industry. We find that there are substantial differences in the configuration of resources that attract DMNEs and EMNEs to regions. The resource configurations in our models account for over 80% of the factors influencing DMNE and EMNE market entry location decisions. Some resources played a more important role in these decisions, such as FDI stocks, cluster size, and manufacturing intensity. Our findings show that EMNEs seek out regions with a greater abundance of different resources than DMNEs. This study provides practical implications for firms entering foreign markets as well as for policy makers who want to attract these firms to bolster their regional economic development. © 2021 by the authors.

For their highly dense populations, it is difficult to control the spread of the virus in cities. As a result, activities that draw large crowds together so that people can access public services are inevitable. Several cities that have been declared as smart cities in Indonesia have made a breakthrough by making use of information and communication technology (ICT)-based applications. This can be of great help for societies during pandemics. ICT has been able to help citizens perform various activities from home with the help of applications. This study aims to identify various applications that support the implementation of the concept of a smart city. This applies particularly to those applications that are based on ICT that can tackle the unique conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic and make recommendations regarding future developments. The data collected for this study were analyzed using secondary sources obtained from various clusters of literature, the internet, and social media. In addition, primary data was gathered from discussion forums. This paper employs a qualitative approach with qualitative descriptive data analysis techniques and hierarchical cluster analysis. Qualitative descriptive analysis was utilized to explore the conditions of smart cities, the regional conditions of the pandemic, and smart city applications more generally. The results show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, cities and regions, including the 100 smart cities in Indonesia, have developed many innovative solutions through ICT-based applications that can help people main-tain an active social life and access public services. In the future, when everything is allegedly back to normal, cities need to implement the use of various ICT-based applications to increase efficiency in their planning and management. Therefore, it has become increasingly necessary to improve peo-ple’s digital literacy and to develop a type of ICT infrastructure that enables more people to access the internet. © 2021 by the authors.

Any form of intrusive action on the SCADA modules and communication networks can create devastating consequences on nations due to their strategic importance to CIs’ operations. Therefore, the prompt and efficient detection and classification of SCADA systems intrusions hold great importance for national CIs operational stability. Due to their well-recognized and documented efficiencies, several literature works have proposed numerous supervised learning techniques for SCADA intrusion detection and classification (IDC). This paper presents a critical review of recent studies whereby supervised learning techniques were modelled for SCADA intrusion solutions. The paper aims to contribute to the state-of-the-art, recognize critical open issues and offer ideas for future studies. The intention is to provide a research-based resource for researchers working on industrial control systems security.

Several reasons can be considered: people are in close contact with each other, i.e., at a short range (1 m), and the healthcare system is not sufficiently developed or does not have enough facilities to manage and fight the pandemic, even in developed countries such as the USA and the U.K. and countries in Europe. There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore®, Web of Science®, and PubMed Central®, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally.

Picky eating can impact this complex activity and has numerous extrinsic (or external) and intrinsic (or internal) features. Occupational therapists work with children and their families by looking at both intrinsic and extrinsic influences and are therefore well-placed to work within this context. This scoping review comprises a comprehensive search of key health industry databases using pre-determined search terms. A robust screening process took place using the authors pre-agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria. There were 80 studies that met the inclusion criteria, which were then mapped using content analysis. The most common assessments used to identify picky eating relied on parental reports and recall. Often additional assessments were included in studies to identify both the intrinsic and extrinsic features and presentation. The most common reported intrinsic features of the child who is a picky eater included increased sensitivity particularly to taste and smell and the child’s personality. Extrinsic features which appear to increase the likelihood of picky eating are authoritarian parenting, rewards for eating, and pressuring the child to eat. Most commonly reported extrinsic features that decrease the likelihood of picky eating are family meals, responsive parents, and involving the child in the preparation of food. In conclusion, there is a lack of published papers addressing the role of occupational therapists in the assessment and identification of picky eating in children. There appears to be a complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic features which impact caregiver responses and therefore on the picky eater. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, detecting and diagnosing obesity as early as possible is crucial. Therefore, the machine learning approach is a promising solution to early predictions of obesity and the risk of overweight because it can offer quick, immediate, and accurate identification of risk factors and condition likelihoods. The present study conducted a systematic literature review to examine obesity research and machine learning techniques for the prevention and treatment of obesity from 2010 to 2020. Accordingly, 93 papers are identified from the review articles as primary studies from an initial pool of over 700 papers addressing obesity. Consequently, this study initially recognized the significant potential factors that influence and cause adult obesity. Next, the main diseases and health consequences of obesity and overweight are investigated. Ultimately, this study recognized the machine learning methods that can be used for the prediction of obesity.

Using an exhaustive set of over 2.4 million Scopus publications, we analyze all researchers who have published with a Russian affiliation address in Scopus-indexed sources in 1996–2020. The migration of researchers is observed through the changes in their affiliation addresses, which altered their mode countries of affiliation across different years. While only 5.2% of these researchers were internationally mobile, they accounted for a substantial proportion of citations. Our estimates of net migration rates indicate that while Russia was a donor country in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it has experienced a relatively balanced circulation of researchers in more recent years. These findings suggest that the current trends in scholarly migration in Russia could be better framed as brain circulation, rather than as brain drain. Overall, researchers emigrating from Russia outnumbered and outperformed researchers immigrating to Russia. Our analysis on the subject categories of publication venues shows that in the past 25 years, Russia has, overall, suffered a net loss in most disciplines, and most notably in the five disciplines of neuroscience, decision sciences, mathematics, biochemistry, and pharmacology. We demonstrate the robustness of our main findings under random exclusion of data and changes in numeric parameters. Our substantive results shed light on new aspects of international mobility in academia, and on the impact of this mobility on a national science system, which have direct implications for policy development.

In terms of this intervention study, 200 Greek Cypriot EFL learners’ essays (pre-and post-tests) were evaluated taking into consideration four aspects of writing quality after using either PA and teacher assessment (TA) (experimental groups, n = 100 students) or only TA (control groups, n = 100 students) in their writing classes for one year. This is one of the few studies, to the knowledge of the present researcher, which have performed text analysis of so many aspects of writing quality using such a—relatively—large sample (400 essays) in such a challenging setting (secondary education). Learners’ essays were evaluated in terms of accuracy, fluency, grammatical complexity, and lexical complexity using Atlas.ti.

The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the human mobility patterns such as daily transportation-related behavior of the public. There is a requirement to understand the disease spread patterns and its routes among neighboring individuals for the timely implementation of corrective measures at the required placement. To increase the effectiveness of contact tracing, countries across the globe are leveraging advancements in mobile technology and Internet of Things (IoT) to aid traditional manual contact tracing to track individuals who have come in close contact with identified COVID-19 patients. Even as the first administration of vaccines begins in 2021, the COVID-19 management strategy will continue to be multi-pronged for the foreseeable future with digital contact tracing being a vital component of the response along with the use of preventive measures such as social distancing and the use of face masks. After some months of deployment of digital contact tracing technology, deeper insights into the merits of various approaches and the usability, privacy, and ethical trade-offs involved are emerging. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of digital contact tracing solutions in terms of their methodologies and technologies in the light of the new data emerging about international experiences of deployments of digital contact tracing technology. We also provide a discussion on open challenges such as scalability, privacy, adaptability and highlight promising directions for future work. © 2021 The Author(s)",App; Contact tracing; COVID-19; Data protection; Internet of things; Privacy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109916085

At the same time, the gravity of environmental issues has put sustainability and the circular economy at the top of corporate agendas. To this end, information systems, in particular business analytics, are being highlighted as essential enablers of an accelerated circular economy transition. However, effectively managing this joint transformation is a challenge. Firms struggle to identify which organizational resources they should target and how those should be leveraged towards a firm-wide business analytics capability for circular economy. To address these questions, this study draws on recent literature dealing with smart circular economy and business analytics capabilities along with the resource-based and resource orchestration view to (1) create an instrument to measure firms’ business analytics capability for circular economy, and (2) examine the relationship among a circular economy-specific business analytics capability, circular economy implementation, resource orchestration capability, and firm performance. The proposed research model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling of survey data from 125 top-level managers at companies across Europe. The results show that firms with a strong business analytics capability have an increased resource orchestration capability and a greater ability to excel in the circular economy, resulting in improved organizational performance in building a more sustainable competitive advantage in an increasingly competitive business landscape. The effect of business analytics capability on firm performance is not direct but fully mediated through resource orchestration capability and circular economy implementation. The results empirically validate the proposed research model and offer pathways to future information systems research streams to support the operationalization of circular strategies. The study provides the first empirical evidence of a business analytics capability for circular economy and its effect on firm performance. © 2021 The Author(s)",Big data analytics; Circular economy capability; Digital circular economy; Digitalization; Policy implication; Sustainability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109410702

The amount of investment in Indian startups in the last decade demonstrates the strong interest of the technology industry to these business models based on innovation. In this context, the present study aims to identify investment opportunities for investors in Indian startups by identifying key indicators that characterize the startup ecosystem in India. To this end, a three steps data mining method is developed using data mining techniques. First, a sentiment analysis (SA), a machine learning approach that classifies the topics into groups expressing feelings, is applied to a dataset. Next, we develop a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a topic-modeling technique that divides the sample of n = 14.531 tweets from Twitter into topics, using user-generated content (UGC) as data. Finally, in order to identify the characteristics of each topic we apply textual analysis (TA) to identify key indicators. The originality of the present study lies in the methodological process used for data analysis. Our results also contribute to the literature on startups. The results demonstrate that the Indian startup ecosystem is influenced by areas such as fintech, innovation, crowdfunding, hardware, funds, competition, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and electronic commerce.

In this paper, time-series satellite images are used to predict urban expansion. As the ground truth is not available in time-series satellite images, an unsupervised image segmentation method based on deep learning is used to generate the ground truth for training and validation. The automated annotated images are then manually validated using Google Maps to generate the ground truth. The remaining data were then manually annotated. Prediction of urban expansion is achieved by using a ConvLSTM network, which can learn the global spatio-temporal information without shrinking the size of spatial feature maps. The ConvLSTM based model is applied on the time-series satellite images and the results of prediction are compared with Pix2pix and Dual GAN networks. In this paper, experimental results are conducted using several multi-date satellite images representing the three largest cities in Saudi Arabia, namely: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The evaluation results show that the proposed ConvLSTM based model produced better prediction results in terms of Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and overall classification accuracy as compared to Pix2pix and Dual GAN.

An effective solution to this problem is Demand Response (DR). Electric Water Heaters (EWHs) are considered ideal candidates for DR due to their energy storage capability. Due to the benefits, control strategies or techniques for EWHs have received considerable academic attention. The energy sector has recently tapped into the disruptive artificial intelligence world to learn, among other related priorities, how to enhance operations, maintain energy resilience and improve consumer service. Consequently, this paper reviews the use of machine learning (ML) for optimization and scheduling of EWHs. The main contributions of this review paper are, firstly, to identify state of the art of energy optimization and scheduling of EWHs. Secondly, to review the current ML models for energy optimization and scheduling of EWHs in smart grids and smart building environment. While classical control strategies may deliver substantial improvements, optimum efficiency may not be reached. ML has demonstrated clear advantages over classical control.

Unfortunately, these concepts can be difficult for novice students to understand. One way students can develop CT skills is to involve them in the design of an application to teach CT. This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students’ understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other’s mini game concepts.

However, energy consumption of a MEC network depends on volatile tasks that induces risk for energy demand estimations. As an energy supplier, a microgrid can facilitate seamless energy supply. However, the risk associated with energy supply is also increased due to unpredictable energy generation from renewable and non-renewable sources. Especially, the risk of energy shortfall is involved with uncertainties in both energy consumption and generation. In this article, we study a risk-aware energy scheduling problem for a microgrid-powered MEC network. First, we formulate an optimization problem considering the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measurement for both energy consumption and generation, where the objective is to minimize the expected residual of scheduled energy for the MEC networks and we show this problem is an NP-hard problem. Second, we analyze our formulated problem using a multi-agent stochastic game that ensures the joint policy Nash equilibrium, and show the convergence of the proposed model. Third, we derive the solution by applying a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm with shared neural networks. This method mitigates the curse of dimensionality of the state space and chooses the best policy among the agents for the proposed problem. Finally, the experimental results establish a significant performance gain by considering CVaR for high accuracy energy scheduling of the proposed model than both the single and random agent models. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",conditional value-at-risk (CVaR); demand-response (DR); microgrid; Multi-access edge computing (MEC); multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; stochastic game,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099423791

Methods: As part of the ZikaPLAN project, an International Committee developed an app for the description and coding of congenital anomalies that are externally visible at birth, for use in low resource settings. The “basic” version of the app was designed for a basic clinical setting and to overcome language and terminology barriers by providing diagrams and photos, sourced mainly from international Birth Defects Atlases. The “surveillance” version additionally allows recording of limited pseudonymized data relevant to diagnosis, which can be uploaded to a secure server, and downloaded by the surveillance program data center. Results: The app contains 98 (88 major and 10 minor) externally visible anomalies and 12 syndromes (including congenital Zika syndrome), with definitions and International Classification of Disease v10 -based code. It also contains newborn examination videos and links to further resources. The user taps a region of the body, then selects among a range of images to choose the congenital anomaly that best resembles what they observe, with guidance regarding similar congenital anomalies. The “basic” version of the app has been reviewed by experts and made available on the Apple and Google Play stores. Since its launch in November 2019, it has been downloaded in 39 countries. The “surveillance” version is currently being field-tested. Conclusion: The global birth defects app is a mHealth tool that can help in developing congenital anomaly surveillance in low resource settings to support prevention and care. © 2021 The Authors.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing. Finally, important research challenges and future directions are also highlighted. © 2014 IEEE.",Blockchain; edge computing; federated learning (FL); Internet of Things (IoT); privacy; security,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104272533

Global changes in climatic variables have impacted and continue to impact marine fish and aquaculture production, where machine learning (ML) methods are yet to be extensively used to study aquatic systems in Malaysia. ML-based algorithms could be paired with feature importance, i.e., (features that have the most predictive power) to achieve better prediction accuracy and can provide new insights on fish production. This research aims to develop an MLbased prediction of marine fish and aquaculture production. Based on the feature importance scores, we select the group of climatic variables for three different ML models: linear, gradient boosting, and random forest regression. The past 20 years (2000–2019) of climatic variables and fish production data were used to train and test the ML models. Finally, an ensemble approach named voting regression combines those three ML models. Performance matrices are generated and the results showed that the ensembled ML model obtains R2 values of 0.75, 0.81, and 0.55 for marine water, freshwater, and brackish water, respectively, which outperforms the single ML model in predicting all three types of fish production (in tons) in Malaysia. © 2021 by the authors.

In a tracking system, an antenna continuously tracks a moving target and records their position. A UAV tracking antenna system is susceptible to signal loss if omnidirectional antenna is deployed as the preferred design. Therefore, to achieve longer UAV distance communication, there is a need for directional high gain antenna. From design principle, directional antennas are known to focus their signal energy in a particular direction viewed from their radiation pattern which is concentrated in a particular azimuth direction. Unfortunately, a directional antenna is limited by angle, thus, it must always be directed to the target. The other limitation of a UAV mechanical beam steering system is that the system is expensive to maintain and with low reliability. To solve this problem, we are proposing the use of MIMO technology as a readily available technology for UAV beyond line of sight technology. Although UAV antenna tracking is domiciled in the mechanical beam steering arrangement, this study shows that this native technology could be usurped by MIMO beam forming. © 2021 by the authors.

With a multitude of features to offer, IoT is a boon to mankind, but just as two sides of a coin, the technology, with its lack of securing information, may result in a big bane. It is estimated that by the year 2030, there will be nearly 25.44 billion IoT devices connected worldwide. Due to the unprecedented growth, IoT is endangered by numerous attacks, impairments, and misuses due to challenges such as resource limitations, heterogeneity, lack of standardization, architecture, etc. It is known that almost 98% of IoT traffic is not encrypted, exposing confidential and personal information on the network. To implement such a technology in the near future, a comprehensive implementation of security, privacy, authentication, and recovery is required. Therefore, in this paper, the comprehensive taxonomy of security and threats within the IoT paradigm is discussed. We also provide insightful findings, presumptions, and outcomes of the challenges to assist IoT developers to address risks and security flaws for better protection. A five-layer and a seven-layer IoT architecture are presented in addition to the existing three-layer architecture.

In view of innovation and the creation of an innovative environment, the influence of leaders not only on the innovativeness of employees, but also of the organization as a whole, is considered one of the most prospective areas of future research. This article explores the influence of leadership behaviour (support for innovation, delegating, intellectual stimulation, and rewards) of top (sample size N = 275) and middle (sample size N = 891) management on the innovative behaviour of military officers. The empirical validation of the selected four leadership behaviours is based on the methodology of quantitative sociological research—a questionnaire. Research results show that strong and statistically significant correlation relationships were established at the level of top managers (commanders) between such factors as Intellectual Stimulation and Delegating, Rewards and Delegating, Delegating and Support for Innovation, as well as Support for Innovation and Rewards. Meanwhile, for middle-level managers (military officers) two strong relationships were found between such factors as Rewards and Delegating, and Delegating and Support for Innovation. Analysis of the compatibility of opinions showed that although commanders and military officers both appreciate the leadership behaviours of the top and middle management of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, it was also found that commanders are more positive about the opportunity to offer new ideas at their military unit. Furthermore, they are more positive about the statement that leadership grants them the right to take decisions and implement them, and they are also more positive about taking the initiative, when they feel support for innovation. The identified difference in the leadership behaviours of top and middle management leads to the conclusion that, at different hierarchical levels of leadership, innovative behaviour of subordinates is influenced differently in the innovation promotion process in the Lithuanian Armed Forces. © 2021 by the authors.

These changes are due to human activities resulting in the emission of greenhouse gases. This is caused by intensive industrial activities and excessive fuel energy consumption. Recently, the scheduling of production systems has been judged to be an effective way to reduce energy consumption. This is the field of green scheduling, which aims to allocate jobs to machines in order to minimize total costs, with a focus on the sustainable use of energy. Several studies have investigated parallel-machine shops, with a special focus on reducing and minimizing the total consumed energy. Few studies explicitly include the idle energy of parallel machines, which is the energy consumed when the machines are idle. In addition, very few studies have considered the elimination of idle machine times as an efficient way to reduce the total consumed energy. This is the no-idle machine constraint, which is the green aspect of the research. In this context, this paper addresses the green parallel-machine scheduling problem, including release dates, delivery times, and no-idle machines, with the objective of minimizing the maximum completion time. This problem is of practical interest since it is encountered in several industry processes, such as the steel and automobile industries. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for use in obtaining exact solutions for small-sized instances. Due to the NP-hardness of the studied problem, and encouraged by the successful adaptation of metaheuristics for green scheduling problems, three genetic algorithms (GAs) using three different crossover operators and a simulated annealing algorithm (SA) were developed for large-sized problems. A new family of lower bounds is proposed. This was intended for the evaluation of the performance of the proposed algorithms over the average percent of relative deviation (ARPD). In addition, the green aspect was evaluated over the percentage of saved energy, while eliminating the idle-machine times. An extensive experimental study was carried out on a benchmark of test problems with up to 200 jobs and eight machines. This experimental study showed that one GA variant dominated the other proposed procedures. Furthermore, the obtained numerical results provide strong evidence that the proposed GA variant outperformed the existing procedures from the literature. The experimental study also showed that the adoption of the no-idle machine time constraints made it possible to reduce the total consumed energy by 29.57%, while the makespan (cost) increased by only 0.12%. © 2021 by the authors.

The edge-enabled ICN-IoT architecture always demands efficient in-network caching techniques for supporting better user’s quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose an enhanced ICN-IoT content caching strategy by enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-based collaborative filtering within the edge cloud to support heterogeneous IoT architecture. This collaborative filtering-based content caching strategy would intelligently cache content on edge nodes for traffic management at cloud databases. The evaluations has been conducted to check the performance of the proposed strategy over various benchmark strategies, such as LCE, LCD, CL4M, and ProbCache. The analytical results demonstrate the better performance of our proposed strategy with average gain of 15% for cache hit ratio, 12% reduction in content retrieval delay, and 28% reduced average hop count in comparison to best considered LCD.

The simulation results cleared that optimal allocation and planning of the DGSCs can be improved the distribution network operation with reducing the power losses and also enhancing the voltage profile. The obtained results confirmed superiority of the MRFO compared with well?known particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the DGSCs allocation. The results also showed that increasing the number of DGSCs reduces more losses and improves more the network voltage profile.

Furthermore, with the incorporation of the IoT into Critical Infrastructure (CI) hardware and applications, the protection of not only the systems but the citizens themselves has become paramount. To do so, specialists must be able to gain a foothold in the ongoing cyber attack war-zone. By organising the various attacks against their systems, these specialists can not only gain a quick overview of what they might expect but also gain knowledge into the specifications of the attacks based on the categorisation method used. This paper presents a glimpse into the area of IoT Critical Infrastructure security as well as an overview and analysis of attack categorisation methodologies in the context of wireless IoT-based Critical Infrastructure applications. We believe this can be a guide to aid further researchers in their choice of adapted categorisation approaches. Indeed, adapting appropriated categorisation leads to a quicker attack detection, identification, and recovery.

In this paper, a Hadoop based framework is proposed to identify the malicious IoT traffic using a modified Tomek?link under?sampling integrated with automated Hyper?param-eter tuning of machine learning classifiers. The novelty of this paper is to utilize a big data platform for benchmark IoT datasets to minimize computational time. The IoT benchmark datasets are loaded in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) environment. Three machine learning ap-proaches namely naive Bayes (NB), K?nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) are used for categorizing IoT traffic. Artificial immune network optimization is deployed during cross?validation to obtain the best classifier parameters. Experimental analysis is performed on the Hadoop platform. The average accuracy of 99% and 90% is obtained for BoT_IoT and ToN_IoT da-tasets. The accuracy difference in ToN?IoT dataset is due to the huge number of data samples cap-tured at the edge layer and fog layer. However, in BoT?IoT dataset only 5% of the training and test samples from the complete dataset are considered for experimental analysis as released by the da-taset developers. The overall accuracy is improved by 19% in comparison with state?of?the?art tech-niques.

Using 461 US employees in the environmental related industries, we found empirical evidence between employees’ green performance, organizational culture and adaptability capability. Finally, the present study suggests two main corporate elements for green policy makers in eco-friendly organizations that the alignment of firm environmental strategy with strategic human resources (HR) should include (1) an organizational culture that supports employee green practices and (2) employee adaptability competency that enables workers to respond to the evolving environmental challenges as main component of analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

The few attempts toward sub-annual reconstructions have relied on statistical disaggregation, which uses none or little proxy information. Here, we develop a novel framework that optimizes proxy combinations to simultaneously produce seasonal and annual reconstructions. Importantly, the framework ensures that total seasonal flow matches annual flow closely. This mass balance criterion is necessary to avoid misguiding water management decisions, such as the allocation of water rights or dam release decisions. Using the framework, and leveraging a multi-species network of ring width and cellulose (Formula presented.) O in Southeast Asia, we reconstruct seasonal and annual inflow to Thailand's largest reservoir. The reconstructions are statistically skillful. Furthermore, they preserve the mass balance well: the differences are mostly within 10% of the mean annual flow. As a result, the reconstructions provide more reliable estimates of the seasonal and annual surface water availability.

The aftermath of natural disasters like floods and earthquakes leads to severe damage to the urban infrastructure. Maintenance operations that follow for the damaged infrastructure often involve a visual inspection and assessment of their state to ensure their functional and physical integrity. Such damage may appear in the form of minor or major cracks, which gradually spread, leading to ultimate collapse or destruction of the structure. Crack detection is a very laborious task if performed via manual visual inspection. Many infrastructure elements need to be checked regularly and it is therefore not feasible as it will require significant human resources. This may also result in cases where cracks go undetected. A need, therefore, exists for performing automatic defect detection in infrastructure to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. Using image processing techniques, the captured or scanned images of the infrastructure parts can be analyzed to identify any possible defects. Apart from image processing, machine learning methods are being increasingly applied to ensure better performance outcomes and robustness in crack detection. This paper provides a review of image-based crack detection techniques which implement image processing and/or machine learning. A total of 30 research articles have been collected for the review which is published in top tier journals and conferences in the past decade. A comprehensive analysis and comparison of these methods are performed to highlight the most promising automated approaches for crack detection. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, the public funds for older residents’ wellbeing are at risk of being cut back under the economic austerity due to the prevalent neoliberalism policy atmosphere. However, some cities set good examples to turn their older citizens into active contributors to sustainable urban development (SUD) by developing age-friendly cities and communities (AFCC). Taking Hong Kong as an example, this study aims to raise a strategy for policymakers, especially at the municipal level, to incorporate the concept of AFCC in SUD. Data were retrieved for our analysis from a published report of the Hong Kong Public Policy Research Fund project. A total of 15 AFCC and SUD policy factors were identified by using factor analysis. The correlations between these policy factors were evaluated and visualised in a synergetic effect network. According to the network, this study indicates that developing the silver hair market can be a suitable entry point to realise SUD by adopting an AFCC development. Isolation prevention, social sustainability and low-energy-consumption development are the supportive policy factors for the silver hair market. Specifically, respect, discrimination prevention, communication and information, age-friendly facilities, environmental safety and public transportation accessibility are five AFCC policy factors incorporated in the policy integration to enhance older residents’ wellbeing further. This study is an innovative attempt to develop a comprehensive model for the synergy between sustainable urban development and an age-friendly city and community using a correlation network.

Relief well design in carbon capture and geological storage (CCS) requires complex processes and excessive iterative procedures to obtain optimal operating parameters, such as CO2 injection rate, water production rate, distance between the wells, and pressure at the wells. To generate training and testing datasets for ANN model development, optimization processes for a relief well with various injection scenarios were performed. Training and testing were conducted, where the best iteration and regression were considered based on the calculated coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. According to validation with a 20-year injection scenario, which was not included in the training datasets, the model showed great performance with R2 values of 0.96 or higher for all the output parameters. In addition, the RMSE values for the BHP and the trapping mechanisms were lower than 0.04. Moreover, the location of the relief well was reliably predicted with a distance difference of only 20.1 m.

Furthermore, we analyze the effect of different technology shocks on sustainable development when the proportion of clean energy is separately set at 10%, 20%, and 40%. To demonstrate the conclusions of the DSGE analysis framework, we construct the sustainability index and measure the relationship between the sustainability index scores and the proportion of clean energy of 68 countries in 2017, and the R of the linear relationship between the sustainability index score and the proportion of clean energy was 0.30. Results show that the technology shock of clean energy exhibits more benefits for sustainable development than that of non-clean energy.

Previous studies have mainly discussed the customer satisfaction and behavioral intention of restaurants, while few studies have explored the influencing factors of customer satisfaction and behavioral intention of chain coffee shops. Given that the perceived service quality theory and DINESERV model can effectively predict customer satisfaction and behavioral intention, this study took 385 consumers in the first Starbucks Reserve flagship store in China as survey objects. SmartPLS 3.0 software was used to explore the relationship among respondents’ perceived service quality, customer perceived value, satisfaction, and behavioral intention. The results show that service quality has a partially significant positive effect on perceived value. Perceived service quality and customers’ perceived value both have significant positive effects on satisfaction. Customers’ satisfaction has a significant positive effect on their behavioral intention. These results indicate that enterprises should strengthen the emotional bond between consumers and enterprises and improve the reliability, assurance, and empathy of perceived service quality to create a better emotional resonance between consumers and the Starbucks brand to improve customer satisfaction. At the same time, it should also promote the symbolic perceived value of Chinese consumers to Starbucks to realize the sustainable development of coffee-shop operation and consumer repurchase. This study expands the research on the service quality, perceived value, and behavioral intention of coffee chain enterprises in the context of non-habitual coffee-drinking countries.

The objective of this paper is to show an analysis of the operation of a landfill leachate treatment system in a Latin American megacity (Bogota, Colombia) by means of auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. A comparative analysis of the leachate treated with respect to reference legislation is carried out. The influence of climate variables during the operation of the treatment system is also considered. The results suggest that the concentrations of heavy metals (HMs), BOD5, and COD in untreated leachate do not follow the same annual cycles observed for the quantity of solid waste disposed within the landfill. This difference is possibly associated with the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the leachate inside the conduction and pre-treatment system (storage/homogenization ponds). The ARIMA analysis suggests an HRT of up to one month (AR = 1) for the HMs identified as indicators of untreated leachate (Cu, Pb, and Zn). It is noted that the removal efficiency of HM indicators of the operation of the leachate treatment plant (Fe and Ni) is probably conditioned by operations carried out over a period of one month (AR = 1). The high input concentration of these HM indicators may prevent changing their ARIMA temporal structure during leachate treatment. This is reflected in the low removal efficiencies for all HMs under study (average = 26.1%). © 2021 by the authors.

But why is this happening now, what are the precursors, and what will happen in the years to come? In this article, we ask how pre-and post-colonial landscape gridding perpetuate a slow violence across the landscape through processes of de-/fencing. Fencing, we argue, is embedded in a landscape logic that favours exclusive rights and conditioned access. In two case studies from grazing lands in Kenya, we explore how people engage with the tension of an imposed landscape logic of fencing by either asserting or challenging its very physicality. We propose that de-/fencing are ways of anticipating long-standing land tenure uncertainties. Moreover, we use our cases to explore different points of reference along the mattering of land tenure boundaries as well as the sort of horizons to which fencing leads. We also use this knowledge to improve our understanding of parallel prehistoric cases of large-scale land tenure boundaries. By unfolding the intertwined socio-political and material nature of gridded landscapes, we seek to bring the study of fencing out of conservation literature and into its wider culture-historical context. © 2021 by the authors.

All areas of activity have been affected by the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (associated with a disease called COVID-19), and all countries are experiencing health crises. The tourism industry, together with its associated fields, experienced a decline during this period that is still difficult to assess. This study examined intentions to travel in the current conditions imposed by the health crisis. Various measures have been recommended or imposed by governments to control the spread of COVID-19. Travel has been significantly influenced by such measures. However, people have various travel needs, from shopping to work and leisure to exploration. The data were collected through an online questionnaire survey addressed to the active population in Romania. The application of this questionnaire coincided with the third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Romania. The conditions related to the degree of incidence of infections in the respondents’ areas and also the connection between the expression of the intention to travel and the protection conditions in the destination areas were analyzed. The entire study was based on office research, statistical analysis, case study methods, and analysis of empirical data obtained through the survey of the active population in Romania. The results explain the travel tendencies of Romanians in the following period. Fear of infection and perceived risk have significantly influenced travel behaviors, but intentions to travel for recreational or leisure purposes have been maintained. The results of this study could be useful in planning and rethinking the activities of the tourism industry in the coming period. © 2021 by the authors.

Since IoT devices generate and exchange sensitive data over the traditional internet, security has become a prime concern due to the generation of zero-day cyberattacks. A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) can provide the much-needed efficient security solution to the IoT network by protecting the network entry points through constant network traffic monitoring. Recent NIDS have a high false alarm rate (FAR) in detecting the anomalies, including the novel and zero-day anomalies. This paper proposes an efficient anomaly detection mechanism using mutual information (MI), considering a deep neural network (DNN) for an IoT network. A comparative analysis of different deep-learning models such as DNN, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and its different variants, such as Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short-term Memory is performed considering the IoT-Botnet 2020 dataset. Experimental results show the improvement of 0.57–2.6% in terms of the model’s accuracy, while at the same time reducing the FAR by 0.23–7.98% to show the effectiveness of the DNN-based NIDS model compared to the well-known deep learning models. It was also observed that using only the 16–35 best numerical features selected using MI instead of 80 features of the dataset result in almost negligible degradation in the model’s performance but helped in decreasing the overall model’s complexity. In addition, the overall accuracy of the DL-based models is further improved by almost 0.99–3.45% in terms of the detection accuracy considering only the top five categorical and numerical features. © 2021 by the authors.

Distilled water is one of the on-demand elements in academic laboratories; however, water scarcity may eventually affect the education sector, necessitating the implementation of new policies. Human behavior, awareness, knowledge, and opinion is having an impact on water management; accordingly, a questionnaire was purposely designed and validated to assess these variables in a Malaysian public university regarding the use of non-distilled water produced by the distillation process. An exploratory factor analysis yielded four factors: “concept of green laboratory and water”, “usage of non-distilled water”, “knowledge about water distillation”, and “behavior related to water conservation”. Using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare laboratory and non-laboratory users’ responses, the variables “Knowledge”, “Behavior”, and “Opinion” revealed statistically significant differences, with laboratory users scoring higher in all four variables. Employing the Kruskal-Wallis H test in an occupation-based comparison among laboratory users, and with an additional variable “Practice”, showed that “Lecturer” has the highest mean rank for “Awareness”, “Behavior”, and “Opinion”, while “Laboratory Assistant” has the highest mean rank for “Knowledge”.

Students could, therefore, attend classes from virtually any location using their mobile devices and Internet access. Despite the prolonged pandemic, little attention has been paid to whether offering courses on a virtual meeting platform is sustainable. This study, therefore, explores the antecedents of students’ intentions regarding the sustained use of virtual meeting platforms for academic courses. We investigated the relationship between technology readiness (TR) and perceived social presence (SP) within a virtual communication setting with course satisfaction and sustained use intention. Data were collected via a survey from 525 college students in South Korea who had attended classes using a virtual meeting platform. Serial mediation analysis revealed a pathway in which SP and course satisfaction in series fully mediate the positive relationship between technology readiness and sustainability. This study discusses the implications in relation to the sustainability of virtual technology-based courses as a replacement of live classroom-based courses from a user perspective. Further research is needed to understand users’ negative experiences of attending courses on virtual meeting platforms. © 2021 by the authors.

First, the actual precipitation values measured by ground weather stations and the spatial distribution of precipitation observed by meteorological satellite remote sensing are used to complete the missing precipitation data through linear interpolation, and the gridded precipitation data covering a group of small hydropower stations are constructed. Then, considering the time lag between changes in the daily power generation of the group of small hydropower stations and precipitation, the partial mutual information method is used to estimate the “time difference” between the two, and combined with the precipitation grid data, a data set of the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation is generated. Finally, using only the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation and historical power generation data, a multimodal deep learning network based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) is constructed, and a highly accurate prediction model for the daily power generation of small hydropower stations is obtained. Taking the real power generation data of a group of small hydropower stations in southern China as an example, after considering the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is as high as 93%, which is approximately 5.8% higher than before considering the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation. In addition, compared with mainstream methods such as support vector regression (SVR) and the long-short-term memory network (LSTM) (the average accuracy is about 87%), and the average accuracy improvement of the proposed method is approximately 6%. © 2021 by the authors.

With the transformation of information and communication technologies (ICT), e-tourism has evolved globally to establish commercial relationships using the Internet for offering tourism-related products, including giving personalised suggestions. The contextual suggestion has emerged as a modified recommendation system that is integrated with information-retrieval techniques within large databases to provide tourists with a list of suggestions based on contexts, such as location, time of day, or day of the week (weekdays or weekends). This study surveyed literature in the field of contextual suggestion and recommendation systems with a focus on e-tourism. The concerns linked with approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems are highlighted in this systematic review, while motivations, recommendations, and practical implications in e-tourism are also discussed in this paper. A query search using the keywords “contextual suggestion system”, “recommendation system”, and “tourism” identified 143 relevant articles published from 2012 to 2020. Four major repositories are considered for searching, namely, (i) Science Direct, (ii) Scopus, (iii) IEEE, and (iv) Web of Science. This review was carried out under the protocols of four phases, namely, (i) query searching in major article repositories, (ii) removal of duplicates, (iii) scan of title and abstract, and (iv) complete reading of articles. To identify the gaps in current research, a taxonomy analysis was exemplified into categories and subcategories. The main categories were highlighted as (i) review articles, (ii) model/framework, and (iii) applications. Critical analysis was carried out on the basis of the available literature on the limitations of approaches used in contextual suggestion and recommendation systems. In conclusion, the approaches used are mainly based on content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, preference-based product ranking, and language modelling. The evaluation measures for the contextual suggestion system include precision, normalized discounted cumulative, and mean reciprocal rank, while test collections comprise Internet resources. Given that the tourism industry contributed to the environmental and social-economic development, contextual suggestion and recommendation systems have presented themselves to be relevant in integrating and achieving SDG 9 and SDG 11 in many ways such as web-based e-services by the government sector and smart gadgets based on reliable and real-time data and information for city planners as well as law enforcement personnel in a sustainable city. © 2021 by the author.

This paradigm shift is being driven by the growth and spread of non-nuclear technologies with strategic applications and by a shift in thinking about the sources of nuclear threats and how they should be addressed, primarily, but not solely, in the United States. Recent scholarship has rightly identified a new set of challenges posed by the development of strategic nonnuclear weaponry (SNNW). But the full implications of this transformation in policy, technology and thinking for the global nuclear order as a whole have so far been underexplored. To remedy this, we look further ahead to the ways in which current trends, if taken to their logical conclusion, have the capacity to usher in a new nuclear era. We argue that in the years ahead, SNNW will increasingly shape the nuclear order, particularly in relation to questions of stability and risk. In the Third Nuclear Age, nuclear deployments, postures, balances, arms control, non-proliferation policy, and the prospects for disarmament, will all be shaped as much by developments in SNNW capabilities as by nuclear weapons. Consequently, we advocate for an urgent reassessment of the way nuclear order and nuclear risks are conceptualised as we confront the challenges of a Third Nuclear Age. © 2021 The Author(s).",Arms Control; Deterrence; Emerging Technology; Escalation; Nuclear Order; Nuclear Risk; Nuclear Weapons; Strategic Stability; Third Nuclear Age,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110384679

Self-supply is invested in and managed by an individual household, accessible on-premises and unregulated. Vulnerability to faecal contamination is a concern due to reliance on low-cost technologies and shallow groundwater. This review aims to evaluate the evidence base on the safety of groundwater self-supply in low- and middle income countries in relation to faecal contamination. Differences in microbial water quality between source types, settings, countries and ownership were investigated. A search of peer-reviewed studies in low- and middle income countries was conducted in online databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest and Environmental Complete. Studies were included if they had sufficient detail about the water samples to be related to groundwater self-supply, contained extractable data on faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including thermotolerant coliform or Escherichia coli and were published in English between 1990 and April 2020. A total of 30 studies were included, resulting in 100 datasets and 26,981 water samples across the studies. FIB were present in 36% self-supply samples. The odds of FIB being detected was significantly higher for unimproved sources (OR=8.19, 95% CI [4.04–16.59], p&lt;0.001) and for sources in low income countries (OR=3.85, 95% CI [1.85–7.69], p&lt;0.001). Self-supply was significantly more likely to be contaminated than piped supply (OR=3.45, 95% CI [1.52–7.82], p=0.003). However, water quality was highly heterogeneous (I2=90.9%). Egger's test found no evidence of small study publication bias for self-supply compared to public supply. No evidence of bias due to lack of randomization or season was found, but study design and quality could potentially bias the results. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 on safe drinking water for all, more attention is needed from governments to engage with self-supply and formulate balanced policy responses. © 2021 The Authors",Faecal contamination; Groundwater; Private water supply; SDG; Self-supply; Water quality,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108892288

Though there have been many models and optimization techniques, the matter of concern is that the increasing complexity and scales of propagation processes continuously refresh the former conclusions. Recently, evolutionary computation (EC) shows its potential in alleviating the concerns by introducing an evolving and developing perspective. With this insight, this paper intends to develop a comprehensive view of how EC takes effect in social propagation. Taxonomy is provided for classifying the propagation problems, and the applications of EC in solving these problems are reviewed. Furthermore, some open issues of social propagation and the potential applications of EC are discussed.

Due to the complexity of land–atmosphere energy exchange and limited observation networks, the influence of VR on the energy balance remains unclear. To improve the understanding of the energy budget change associated with VR in the Loess Plateau (LP), we performed a series of sensitivity simulation experiments using the Community Land Model within the Community Earth System Model, and the spatiotemporal responses of energy exchange to VR and the roles of VR in the variations in energy budget under climate change were investigated. The results showed that the land cover changes from 2000 to 2015 exerted a positive effect on net radiation (NR) and sensible heat (SH), and evident increases in annual mean NR and SH were found in the southeastern LP where larger-scale cropland was converted to grassland or forestland, with increasing magnitudes exceeding 2 W/m2. Latent heat (LH) increased only during May–July, particularly on the southern edge of LP. The increasing magnitudes of NR and LH under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 were larger than those under RCP4.5, with the greatest differences being approximately 4 W/m2 and 5 W/m2 during 2081–2100 for NR and LH, respectively. SH remained nearly stable under RCP4.5 and showed a weak decrease under RCP8.5. Under the same RCP, only slight differences in the energy budget components were detected between the land cover condition in 2015 and 2000, with the largest difference of 0.8 W/m2 in SH during 2021–2040. These results suggested that although both VR and climate warming exerted positive effects on NR, the impact of climate change was larger than that of VR in the LP, and a shift in the local surface energy budget toward LH would occur with climate warming. © 2021 The Authors",Change detection; Energy exchange; Land cover change; Loess Plateau; Reforestation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105878273

However, an accurate prediction of salinity concentration in groundwater remains a challenge due to the complexity of groundwater salinization processes and its influencing factors. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting groundwater salinity and identify its influencing factors. We conducted a study for the coastal multi-layer aquifers of the Mekong River Delta (Vietnam), using a geodatabase of 216 groundwater samples and 14 conditioning factors. We compared the predictive performances of different ML techniques, i.e., the Random Forest Regression (RFR), the Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR), the CatBoost Regression (CBR), and the Light Gradient Boosting Regression (LGBR) models. The model performance was assessed by using root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results show that the CBR model has the highest performance with both training (R2 = 0.999, RMSE = 29.90) and testing datasets (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 205.96, AIC = 720.60, and BIC = 751.04). Ten of the 14 influencing factors, including the distance to saline sources, the depth of screen well, the groundwater level, the vertical hydraulic conductivity, the operation time, the well density, the extraction capacity, the thickness of the aquitard, the distance to fault, and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors for groundwater salinity prediction. The results provide insights for policymakers in proposing remediation and management strategies for groundwater salinity issues in the context of excessive groundwater exploitation in coastal lowland regions. Since the human-induced influencing factors have significantly influenced groundwater salinization, urgent actions should be taken into consideration to ensure sustainable groundwater management in the coastal areas of the Mekong River Delta. © 2021 The Authors",CatBoost Regression; Groundwater salinization; Influencing factors; Mekong Delta; Multi-layer coastal aquifers,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105865850

However, TSF prediction has received little attention because a thunderstorm event is a combination of intricate and unique weather scenarios with high instability, making it difficult to predict. To close this gap, we proposed two novel hybrid machine learning models through hybridization of data pre-processing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with two state-of-arts models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for TSF prediction at three categories over Bangladesh. We have demarcated the yearly TSF datasets into three categories for the period 1981–2016 recorded at 28 sites; high (March–June), moderate (July–October), and low (November–February) TSF months. The performance of the proposed EEMD-ANN and EEMD-SVM hybrid models was compared with classical ANN, SVM, and autoregressive integrated moving average. EEMD-ANN and EEMD-SVM hybrid models showed 8.02–22.48% higher performance precision in terms of root mean square error compared to other models at high-, moderate-, and low-frequency categories. Eleven out of 21 input parameters were selected based on the random forest variable importance analysis. The sensitivity analysis results showed that each input parameter was positively contributed to building the best model of each category, and thunderstorm days are the most contributing parameters influencing TSF prediction. The proposed hybrid models outperformed the conventional models where EEMD-ANN is the most skillful for high TSF prediction, and EEMD-SVM is for moderate and low TSF prediction. The findings indicate the potential of hybridization of EEMD with the conventional models for improving prediction precision. The hybrid models developed in this work can be adopted for TSF prediction in Bangladesh as well as different parts of the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Bangladesh; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Hybrid model; Random forest; Sensitivity analysis; Thunderstorm,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104699159

Here, a CNN-based workflow is proposed to discriminate hominid teeth. Our hope is that this method could help confirm otherwise questionable records of Homo from Pleistocene deposits where there is a standing risk of mis-attributing molars of Pongo to Homo. Methods and materials: A two-step workflow was designed. The first step is converting the enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) into EDJ card, that is, a two-dimensional image conversion of the three-dimensional EDJ surface. In this step, researchers must carefully orient the teeth according to the cervical plane. The second step is training the CNN learner with labeled EDJ cards. A sample consisting of 53 fossil Pongo and 53 Homo (modern human and Neanderthal) was adopted to generate EDJ cards, which were then separated into training set (n = 84) and validation set (n = 22). To assess the feasibility of this workflow, a Pongo-Homo classifier was trained from the aforementioned EDJ card set, and then the classifier was used to predict the taxonomic affinities of six samples (test set) from von Koenigswald's Chinese Apothecary collection. Results: Results show that EDJ cards in validation set are classified accurately by the CNN learner. More importantly, taxonomic predictions for six specimens in test set match well with the diagnosis results deduced from multiple lines of evidence, implying the great potential of CNN method. Discussion: This workflow paves a way for future studies using CNN to address taxonomic complexity (e.g., distinguishing Pongo and Homo teeth from the Pleistocene of Asia). Further improvements include visual interpretation and extending the applicability to moderately worn teeth. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",convolutional neural network; deep learning; hominid teeth; taxonomy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104513590

This is more sensitive in the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin, where precipitation uncertainty and hydrological droughts often overshadow the effectiveness of these irrigation schemes, challenging the water-food security efforts in general. To explore this issue, we developed a numerical framework, based on a groundwater model using MODFLOW-NWT, coupled with the outputs of the crop model DSSAT. The framework was implemented in an irrigated site namely, the Koga irrigation scheme, located within in the UBN Basin, Ethiopia. The coupling of groundwater modelling with crop water modelling in data scarce environments is a key contribution of this work. The groundwater model was calibrated with in situ data collected via a Citizen Science Initiative (CSI) for hydraulic head (H) and soil moisture?; and against a distributed hydrological model (CREST) simulated evapotranspiration (ET). Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) values of 0.047, 0.05, and 0.06 were obtained through calibration for H, ?, and ET, respectively. The model was specifically used to simulate the vadose zone water availability due to irrigation, and water-food security aspects associated with extremely dry years. We investigated the hydrologic effect of three irrigation scenarios (non-regulated: NREG, regulated: REG, and regulated with groundwater pumping: REG+GW) aimed at reducing crop water stress derived by one-way coupling of MODFLOW with the crop model Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). © 2021 The Authors",Agricultural water management; Crop water stress; Groundwater model; Irrigation scenarios; Upper Blue Nile; Vadose zone,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104186642

Like today, in PI the maritime ports will fulfil roles as continental and global hubs. Differently than ports today, however, decisions to split and bundle cargo across ships and other modes will not be made solely on the basis of long-term agreements by ports, but rather ever more dynamically and in real-time, aiming to reconsolidate shipments within the port area. This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally.

With the rapid growth of network users and the emergence of new networking services, network traffic classification has attracted increasing attention. Many new traffic classification techniques have been developed and widely applied. However, the existing literature lacks a thorough survey to summarize, compare and analyze the recent advances of network traffic classification in order to deliver a holistic perspective. This paper carefully reviews existing network traffic classification methods from a new and comprehensive perspective by classifying them into five categories based on representative classification features, i.e., statistics-based classification, correlation-based classification, behavior-based classification, payload-based classification, and port-based classification. A series of criteria are proposed for the purpose of evaluating the performance of existing traffic classification methods. For each specified category, we analyze and discuss the details, advantages and disadvantages of its existing methods, and also present the traffic features commonly used. Summaries of investigation are offered for providing a holistic and specialized view on the state-of-art. For convenience, we also cover a discussion on the mostly used datasets and the traffic features adopted for traffic classification in the review.

Besides, grid architectures including DC, AC, or hybrid power generation systems, energy dispatching problems modelling, operating modes (islanded or grid connected), MGs sizing, simulations and problems solving optimization approaches, and other aspects, have been raised as topics of great interest for both electrical and computer sciences research communities. Furthermore, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and government policies and incentives have paved the way to massive electric vehicle (EV) deployment. Hence, several research studies have been conducted to investigate the integration of EVs in national power grid and future MGs. Specifically, EV charging stations’ bi-directional power flow control and energy management have been considerably explored. These issues index challenging research topics, which are in most cases still under progress. This paper gives an overview of MGs technology advancement in recent decades, taking into consideration distributed energy generation (DER), energy storage systems (ESS), EVs, and loads. It reviews the main MGs architecture, operating modes, sizing and energy management systems (EMS) and EVs integration. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to explore the future direction of education by examining the current impact and predicting future impacts of AI. It also examined research trends and collaboration status by country through network analysis, topic modeling and global research trends in AI in education (AIED), by applying the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. Over the past 20 years, the number of papers on AIED has steadily increased, with a dramatic rise since 2015. The research can be broadly classified into eight topics, including “changes in the content of teaching and learning.” Using a linear regression model, three hot topics, two cold topics and trend changes for each research topic were identified. The study found that AIED research should be more thematically diversified and in-depth; this directly applies AI algorithms and technologies to education, which should be further promoted. This study provides a reference for exploring the direction of future AIED research. © 2021 by the authors.

We applied the audio–video information exchange and boosting methods to regularize the training process and reduced the computational costs by using a separable convolution strategy. In sum, our empirical findings are as follows: (1) Multimodal representations efficiently capture all acoustic and visual emotional clues included in each music video, (2) the computational cost of each neural network is significantly reduced by factorizing the stand-ard 2D/3D convolution into separate channels and spatiotemporal interactions, and (3) information-sharing methods incorporated into multimodal representations are helpful in guiding individual information flow and boosting overall performance.

The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture when smart solutions and technologies have become ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this review, we examine how smart city solutions and technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities. For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and technologies during the pandemic. The results were synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition, the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus, provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful attention to important issues and challenges related to privacy and security, access to open-source data, technological affordance, legal barriers, technological feasibility, and citizen engagement. Despite this, this review shows that further development of smart city initiatives can provide unprecedented opportunities for enhancing resilience to the pandemic and similar future events. © 2021 by the authors.

Maintenance is one of these processes, where the introduction of a predictive approach, as opposed to the traditional techniques, is expected to considerably improve the industry maintenance strategies with gains such as reduced downtime, improved equipment effectiveness, lower maintenance costs, increased return on assets, risk mitigation, and, ultimately, profitable growth. With predictive maintenance, dedicated sensors monitor the critical points of assets. The sensor data then feed into machine learning algorithms that can infer the asset health status and inform operators and decision-makers. With this in mind, in this paper, we present TIP4.0, a platform for predictive maintenance based on a modular software solution for edge computing gateways. TIP4.0 is built around Yocto, which makes it readily available and compliant with Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or proprietary hardware. TIP4.0 was conceived with an industry mindset with communication interfaces that allow it to serve sensor networks in the shop floor and modular software architecture that allows it to be easily adjusted to new deployment scenarios. To showcase its potential, the TIP4.0 platform was validated over COTS hardware, and we considered a public data-set for the simulation of predictive maintenance scenarios. We used a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which provided competitive performance over the state-of-the-art approaches, while being approximately four-times and two-times faster than the uncompressed model inference on the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphical Processing Unit, respectively.

The seeder employed an independent vortex pump to provide the air source for the seed metering device. According to the requirements of air flow in the seed metering device, a sub-pipeline and a general pipeline were designed. The performances of the two types of pipelines were verified by the air pressure uniformity tests. The results showed that the sub-pipeline can distribute the air pressure more evenly than the general pipeline. The coefficient of variation of the sub-pipeline pressure was less than 5%. Wuyou 1179 hybrid rice was selected as the experimental object. The field seeding tests were carried out with different negative pressures and different numbers of groups of sucking holes as experimental factors. The results showed that the average qualified rate of seeding was 93.35% when only 2 groups of sucking holes were working under the seed sucking negative pressure of 2.0 kPa. The average qualified rate of seeding was 87.21% when 3 groups of sucking holes were working under the seed sucking negative pressure of 1.6 kPa.

The market is providing various consumer-oriented smart IoT devices; the mainstream cloud service providers are building their software stacks to support IoT services. With this emerging trend even growing, the security of such smart IoT cloud systems has drawn much research attention in recent years. To better understand the emerging consumer-oriented smart IoT cloud systems for practical engineers and new researchers, this article presents a review of the most recent research efforts on existing, real, already deployed consumer-oriented IoT cloud applications in the past five years using typical case studies. Specifically, we first present a general model for the IoT cloud ecosystem. Then, using the model, we review and summarize recent, representative research works on emerging smart IoT cloud system security using 10 detailed case studies, with the aim that the case studies together provide insights into the insecurity of current emerging IoT cloud systems. We further present a systematic approach to conduct a security analysis for IoT cloud systems. Based on the proposed security analysis approach, we review and suggest potential security risk mitigation methods to protect IoT cloud systems. We also discuss future research challenges for the IoT cloud security area. © 2021 ACM.",Case study; Cloud; Consumer-oriented smart applications; IoT; Security,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109212394

In addition, the mediating mechanism of absorptive capacity, intra-firm networks, and design thinking through which entrepreneurial leaders influence product innovation performanceis also studied. The researcher contacted three hundred (300) plus firms; 157 firms showed a willingness to participate, and 96 firms provided the data with a response rate of 61.15%. Out of those 96 firms, the data from 71 firms were used for the final analysis, yielding an effective response rate of 45.22%. Only middle and top-level employees from the marketing and research & development departments from Pakistani firms were selected as respondents because these two departments are directly related to product innovation performance. To test the hypothesis, the Smart PLS-SEM technique wasused. The empirical analysis revealed that entrepreneurial leadership impacted product innovation performance through the mediating mechanism of design thinking, intra-firm networks, and absorptive capacity.

The model led to significant improvements in the prediction of the intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, relatively large errors have been found in a cluster located in the tropical western North Pacific (TWNP), mainly because of the large predictand variance. In this study, a decision-tree algorithm was employed to reduce the predictand variance for TCs in the TWNP. The tree predicts the likelihood of a TC reaching a maximum lifetime intensity greater than 70 knots at its genesis. The developed four rules suggest that the pre-existing ocean thermal structures along the track and the latitude of a TC’s position play significant roles in the determination of its intensity. The developed decision-tree classification exhibited 90.0% and 80.5% accuracy in the training and test periods, respectively. These results suggest that intensity prediction with the CSTIPS-DAT can be further improved by developing independent statistical models for TC groups classified by the present algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

In surveillance systems, recognizing faces captured far away from the camera under various lighting conditions, such as in the daytime and nighttime, is a challenging task. A system capable of recognizing face images in both daytime and nighttime and at various distances is called Cross-Spectral Cross Distance (CSCD) face recognition. In this paper, we proposed a phase-based CSCD face recognition approach. We employed Homomorphic filtering as photometric normalization and Band Limited Phase Only Correlation (BLPOC) for image matching. Different from the state-of-the-art methods, we directly utilized the phase component from an image, without the need for a feature extraction process. The experiment was conducted using the Long-Distance Heterogeneous Face Database (LDHF-DB). The proposed method was evaluated in three scenarios: (i) cross-spectral face verification at 1m, (ii) cross-spectral face verification at 60m, and (iii) cross-spectral face verification where the probe images (near-infrared (NIR) face images) were captured at 1m and the gallery data (face images) was captured at 60m. The proposed CSCD method resulted in the best recognition performance among the CSCD baseline approaches, with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 5.34% and a Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) of 93%. © 2021 by the authors.

Event topics were identified by Word2vec and K-means clustering. The biLSTM model was used to identify emotion in posts. The propagation maps of topic and emotion were presented visually on the network, and the synergistic relationship between topic and emotion propagation as well as the communication characteristics of multiple subjects were analyzed. The results show that there were similarities and differences in the propagation mechanism of topic and emotion in different types of emergencies.

However, CNNs have mostly been applied to noise-free emotional speech data, and limited evidence is available for their applicability in emotional speech denoising. In this study, a cascaded denoising CNN (DnCNN)–CNN architecture is proposed to classify emotions from Korean and German speech in noisy conditions. The proposed architecture consists of two stages. In the first stage, the DnCNN exploits the concept of residual learning to perform denoising; in the second stage, the CNN performs the classification. The classification results for real datasets show that the DnCNN– CNN outperforms the baseline CNN in overall accuracy for both languages. For Korean speech, the DnCNN–CNN achieves an accuracy of 95.8%, whereas the accuracy of the CNN is marginally lower (93.6%). For German speech, the DnCNN–CNN has an overall accuracy of 59.3–76.6%, whereas the CNN has an overall accuracy of 39.4–58.1%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying the DnCNN with residual learning to speech denoising and the effectiveness of the CNN-based approach in speech emotion recognition. Our findings provide new insights into speech emotion recognition in adverse conditions and have implications for language-universal speech emotion recognition. © 2021 by the authors.

However, in some regions the ampleness of the phenomenon is not quantifiable or comparable due to the lack of an adequate framework and reliable metrics. Our research intends to make a little light by assessing the degree of m-learning adoption in students at a moment when face-to-face education moved suddenly online due to the COVID-19 outbreak's rapid and unpredictable spread. A new model relying on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was built to investigate and explain relationships between constructs. It reveals the key factors affecting technology adoption by considering hedonic motivation a mediator instead of an exogenous variable as in UTAUT2. Based on an analysis of 311 higher education learners, the way how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions influence directly or indirectly the behavioral intention is researched. The analysis was conducted employing partial least squares structural equation modeling. The strongest relationship is between hedonic motivation and behavioral intention followed by the one between perceived effectiveness and hedonic motivation. Age, gender, and experience moderate the model's relationships. Research contributes to theory development by successfully adjusting the original UTAUT model.

Despite large research efforts on IRES during the past few decades, there is a need for developing a systemic approach to IRES that considers their hydrological, hydrogeological, hydraulic, ecological, and biogeochemical properties and processes, as well as their interactions with human societies. Thus, we assert that the interdisciplinary approach to ecosystem research promoted by critical zone sciences and socio-ecology is relevant. These approaches rely on infrastructure—Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) and Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) platforms—that are representative of the diversity of IRES (e.g., among climates or types of geology. We illustrate this within the French CZO and LTSER, including their diversity as socio-ecosystems, and detail human interactions with IRES. These networks are also specialized in the long-term observations required to detect and measure ecosystem responses of IRES to climate and human forcings despite the delay and buffering effects within ecosystems. The CZO and LTSER platforms also support development of innovative techniques and data analysis methods that can improve characterization of IRES, in particular for monitoring flow regimes, groundwater-surface water flow, or water biogeochemistry during rewetting. We provide scientific and methodological perspectives for which this interdisciplinary approach and its associated infrastructure would provide relevant and original insights that would help fill knowledge gaps about IRES.

However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus. Overall, haloculture is an essential system, which COVID-19 has accelerated in the agricultural sector. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Agribusiness; Biosaline agriculture; Coronavirus; Ecofriendly; Pandemic,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105473220

In this work, a fully biodegradable ferroelectric nanogenerator-driven skin sensor with ultrasensitive bimodal sensing capability based on edible porcine skin gelatine is demonstrated. The microstructure and molecular engineering of gelatine induces polarization confinement that gives rise the ferroelectric properties, resulting in a piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of ?24 pC N?1 and pyroelectric coefficient of ?13 µC m?2K?1, which are 6 and 11.8 times higher, respectively, than those of the conventional planar gelatine. The ferroelectric gelatine skin sensor has exceptionally high pressure sensitivity (?41 mV Pa?1) and the lowest detection limit of pressure (?0.005 Pa) and temperature (?0.04 K) ever reported for ferroelectric sensors. In proof-of-concept tests, this device is able to sense the spatially resolved pressure, temperature, and surface texture of an unknown object, demonstrating potential for robotic skins and wearable electronics with zero waste footprint. © 2021 The Authors.

Organisations worldwide make huge investments in information security technological countermeasures. Nonetheless, organisations in many cases fail to protect their information assets as they rely mainly on technical solutions which are not contextually compatible and sufficient. As a matter of fact, a significant number of organisational information security incidents are due to the exploitation of human elements that directly and/or indirectly cause the majority of security incidents. Therefore, employees’ information security awareness (ISA) becomes one of the critical aspects of protection against undesirable information security behaviours. However, to date, there is limited synthesised knowledge about methods for enhancing ISA and integrated insights on factors affecting employees’ ISA levels. This study, therefore, provides a systematic review of the literature on ISA and puts forward a state-of-the-art collection of ISA methods and factors for enhancing employees’ ISA within both private and public sector organisations. The results indicate that various methods and factors are used to enhance employees’ ISA in organisations. Theoretical models and gamification are the methods widely used in both private and public organisations, whereas the constructivist approach and violation detections are some of the methods used only in private organisations. Furthermore, this study offers some insights into the latest trends in ISA content development methods and factors, and fosters good ISA practice by disseminating information and knowledge amongst Information Security professionals to help them build an overarching ISA development programme in their organisations. © 2021 The Author(s)",Awareness factors; Awareness methods; Information security awareness; Information Security Management; Literature review; Private organisations; Public organisations,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104919535

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds segmentation and accurate classification are challenging and crucial to produce different geo-information products like three-dimensional (3D) city designs. This paper introduces an effective data-driven approach to build roof superstructures classification for airborne LiDAR point clouds with very low density and imbalanced classes, covering an urban area. Notably, it focuses on building roof superstructures (especially dormers and chimneys) and mitigating nonplanar objects' problems. Also, the imbalanced class problem of LiDAR data, to the best of our knowledge, is not yet addressed in the literature; it is considered in this study. The major advantage of the proposed approach is using only raw data without assumptions on the distribution underlying data. The main methodological novelties of this work are summarized in the following key elements. (i) At first, an adapted connected component analysis for 3D points cloud is proposed. (ii) Twelve geometry-based features are extracted for each component. (iii) A Support Vector Machine (SVM)-driven procedure is applied to classify the 3D components. (iv) Furthermore, a new component size-based sampling (CSBS) method is proposed to treat the imbalanced data problem and has been compared with several existing resampling strategies. In this study, components are classified into five classes: shed and gable dormers, chimneys, ground, and others. The results of this investigation show the satisfying classification performance of the proposed approach. Results also showed that the proposed approach outperformed machine learning methods, including SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Adaboost. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",3D classification; imbalanced data; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); Low-density point cloud; roof superstructures,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104673871

Flash-forward to 2020, Basilicata is one of the poorest regions in Italy despite the exploitation of some of the largest onshore hydrocarbon reserves within the European Union. The coincidence of high poverty rates with abundant natural resources suggests that the region is experiencing a ‘resource curse’; however, socio-economic problems predate the oil boom, complicating any causality claim. To disentangle and estimate the effects of oil exploitation, we employ the synthetic control method that compares the actual trends of development indicators of Basilicata with a counterfactual that is created by taking a weighted average of trends of other Italian regions –a ‘synthetic’ Basilicata. The analysis finds that the development of oil operations has generated no detectable improvement to employment, nor to a range of social indicators, nor to educational attainment. The absence of quantifiable beneficial effects is coupled with negative impacts on other dimensions of development that are more difficult to estimate with our method –especially on the environment and human health. Taken together the evidence offers a sobering prospect over the potential of resource-based development for disadvantaged regions in developed countries. © 2021 The Author(s)",Extractive industries; Gas; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Subnational resource curse,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103762405

Despite offering multiple affordances, many O2O services have not diffused as anticipated, indicating the existence of consumer resistance towards them. One such example is that of food delivery apps (FDAs), which are experiencing resistance at both the pre-adoption and post-adoption stage. However, there are scarce empirical findings explicating the pre-and post-adoption barriers perceived to be associated with FDAs. The present study addresses this gap by utilising the Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) and a convergent mixed-method study design to examine the barriers that existing FDA users face and how these impinge on their trust and valence of recommendation behaviour (positive and negative word of mouth). The study not only extends the classic IRT barriers to the FDA-context by identifying three key barriers (economic, efficiency, and experience) but also offers empirical evidence to support the negative association of barriers with trust and paradoxical recommendation behaviour by analysing data collected from 303 FDA users through Prolific. The findings also support the mediation effect of trust and the moderation effect of advertisement overload on the identified associations, making interesting theoretical and practical contributions. © 2021 The Author(s)",Barriers; Consumer resistance; Food delivery apps (FDAs); Innovation resistance theory; Online to offline (O2O); Structural equation modelling (SEM); Word of mouth (WOM),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103636743

However, there is a lack of investigation on how people choose to assume or be appointed different CIB roles during such leisure projects. Thus, limited information support is provided to travellers involved in group trips. This article investigates role adoption to show how group travellers involved in CIB through different actions. A naturalistic inquiry on CIB was conducted with 20 travel groups from mainland China to Australia. Of these, 36 real tourists participated in the study through initial demographic questionnaires, pre- and post-trip interviews, and self-reported diaries during the travel. Data were analysed using iterative coding guided by the constructivist grounded theory. Results suggested the complexity of CIB among group travellers. Besides searching together as equal peers, most group travellers voluntarily assume different CIB roles which are often implicit. Six distinct CIB roles were identified, including team player, all-rounder, influencer, authoritarian, supporter, and follower. Furthermore, the distribution of such roles in a travel group was examined and classified into five patterns. The findings also contribute to information seeking research in tourism discipline.

However, research in this field has not received sufficient attention, and extracting useful information is still challenging. This paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing social media data like public attitudes toward disaster response and public demands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types, durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper, public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets, which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies, satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model, the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different natural disasters and the evolution of peoples’ behavior of using social media for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as Twitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate the feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide relief agencies with insights into better disaster management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Big data analytics; Disaster response; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100702177

National level policies have traditionally been sector-based, covering fisheries, tourism, environment etc. Recently more integrated and holistic National Ocean Policies (NOP) have been promulgated. The Pacific Ocean also has well-developed regional ocean-related policies spanning decades. The work presented here uses lexicometric analysis to map the interlinkages between regional and national policies to determine if they are evolving synergistically. Focusing on the Solomon Islands, due to its reliance on the ocean and producing a NOP in 2018, 13,622 expressions were extracted from the corpus of 8 national and 10 regional ocean-related policies. Network analysis displayed limited differentiation between the NOP, national sector-based policies and regional policies. Clustering of policies showed progressive splitting of policies from a single cluster, rather than by formation of a number of separate clusters. This behaviour reflects the thematic interlocking of policies: all share many themes, and the more integrative policies add a few additional sectoral themes. The themes rarely addressed in the corpus include energy, agriculture, pollution and education. The NOP was predominantly built on existing national or regional policies and their main themes rather than setting a new direction in ocean governance. The benefit of the NOP may be less about its content itself, but the creation of allied cross-ministerial architecture. With the intense pressure on the oceans and its resources in present times, there will be a growing need for more substantive policy evolution. © Copyright © 2021 Hills, Lajaunie, Maharaj and Mazzega.",lexicometry; network; ocean; Pacific; policy; regional; Solomon Islands; sustainability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110317341

By understanding al-Ghazali as an Ash'arite theologian, a particular strand of Sunni theology, his metaphysical and hermeneutic ideas are taken to explore if and how much Neo-Darwinian evolution can be accepted. It is shown that his ideas can be used to reach an alignment between Islam and Neo-Darwinian evolution. This book offers a detailed examination that seeks to offer clarity if not agreement in the midst of an intense intellectual conflict and polarity amongst Muslims.

Developing on the notion of ""Coloniality of Data"", the fourth industrial revolution is postulated as the final phase which will conclude Africa's peregrination towards recolonisation. Global cartels, networks of coloniality, and tech multinational corporations have turned big data into capital, which is largely unregulated or poorly regulated in Africa as the continent lacks the strong institutions necessary to regulate the mining of data.

Holocene speleothem <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>?</i>18O</span> records show distinct and coherent regional trends. Trends are similar to summer insolation in India, China and southwestern South America, but they are different in the Indonesian-Australian region.

Regression analysis of simulated precipitation <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>?</i>18O</span> and climate variables show significant relationships between global Holocene monsoon <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>?</i>18O</span> trends and changes in precipitation, atmospheric circulation and (to a lesser extent) source area temperature, whereas precipitation recycling is non-significant. However, there are differences in regional-scale mechanisms: there are clear relationships between changes in precipitation and <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>?</i>18O</span> for India, southwestern South America and the Indonesian-Australian regions but not for the East Asian monsoon.

This evolution of technologies is a response to the needs of the energy transition to a low carbon economy. A nanogrid is dependent on local resources through appropriate DG, confined within the boundaries of an energy domain not exceeding 100 kW of power. It can be a single building that is equipped with a local electricity generation to fulfil the building’s load consumption requirements, it is electrically interconnected with the external power system and it can optionally be equipped with a storage system. It is, however, mandatory that a nanogrid is equipped with a controller for optimisation of the production/consumption curves. This study presents design consideretions for nanogrids and the design of a nanogrid system consisting of a 40 kWp photovoltaic (PV) system and a 50 kWh battery energy storage system (BESS) managed via a central converter able to perform demand-side management (DSM).

Water is a basic physiological need, and smart management of water plays a significant role in a smart city. This paper focuses on a mathematical model and IoT framework that aid in developing a smart city. A framework is developed for water supply management. The efficiency of the water supply can be measured by monitoring leakage conditions, overflow of water, automatic meter reading and online bill payments, and water consumption status of households, community, state, and eventually the whole country as well as the automatic water supply line cut-off. The system where the IoT is being deployed consists of embedded hardware in which sensors and microcontrollers provide messages and gain feedback from each other with the help of the in-ternet, and this process can not only be monitored but also can be controlled from a remote location. The developed framework addresses all these aspects and mathematical equations are used and formulated while developing the IoT application. The mathematical equations are concentrated on consumption level (CL), leakage reporting (LR), and bill amount (BA) based on consumption. These become the point of contact for deploying IoT and eventually a framework is developed. This framework can be useful not only in water supply management but also in the management of road traf-fic, pollution, garbage, home automation and so on. In a nutshell, this paper illustrates the usage of the IoT framework in water supply management which contributes to developing the smart city. © 2021 by the authors.

Since we need to simulate the physical phenomenon of multi?stage hydraulic frac-turing. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an alternative proxy model based on data-driven deep learning model. Furthermore, this study not only proposes the development process of a proxy model, but also verifies using field data for 1239 horizontal wells from the Montney shale formation in Alberta, Canada. A deep neural network (DNN) based on multi?layer perceptron was applied to predict the cumulative gas production as the dependent variable. The independent variable is largely divided into four types: well information, completion and hydraulic fracturing and production data. It was found that the prediction performance was better when using a principal component with a cumulative contribution of 85% using principal component analysis that extracts important information from multivariate data, and when predicting with a DNN model using 6 variables calculated through variable importance analysis. Hence, to develop a reliable deep learning model, sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters was performed to determine one?hot encoding, dropout, activation function, learning rate, hidden layer number and neuron number. As a result, the best prediction of the mean absolute percentage error of the cumulative gas production improved to at least 0.2% and up to 9.1%. The novel approach of this study can also be applied to other shale formations.

Consequently, it is a daunting task to assess the cultural heritage potential of a country, region, or community unambiguously. The paper defines “cultural heritage potential” and presents an example of a synthetic assessment of the potential with Poland as an example. The assessment involved several normalised diagnostic variables grouped into four thematic fields. This way, cultural heritage potential could be represented by a “synthetic quality index”. The analysis yielded a ranked list of voivodeships (third-tier subdivision units) and their classification (typology) regarding cultural heritage potential. An in-depth analysis demonstrated that the cultural heritage potential rank of a voivodeship could be determined by values of selected diagnostic valuables, such as the number of heritage objects, number of food products of documented quality and particular cultural significance, and extensive cultural infrastructure. The typology can be a background for decision-making with the consequences of voivodeship classification depending on the context of a specific analysis. The proposed method for assessing cultural heritage potential is not related to the territorial extent of the area. Any quantifiable attribute of cultural heritage can be used in the assessment regardless of the unit of measure. Such an assessment can be useful for the identification of trouble areas, areas of concern, and model areas. © 2021 by the author.

Network technology connecting physical systems and computing systems enables the simultaneous control of many physical systems and provides intelligent applications for them. However, enhancing connectivity leads to extended attack vectors in which attackers can trespass on the network and launch cyber-physical attacks, remotely disrupting the CPS. Therefore, extensive studies into cyber-physical security are being conducted in various domains, such as physical, network, and computing systems. Moreover, large-scale and complex CPSs make it difficult to analyze and detect cyber-physical attacks, and thus, machine learning (ML) techniques have recently been adopted for cyber-physical security. In this survey, we provide an extensive review of the threats and ML-based security designs for CPSs. First, we present a CPS structure that classifies the functions of the CPS into three layers: the physical system, the network, and software applications. Then, we discuss the taxonomy of cyber-physical attacks on each layer, and in particular, we analyze attacks based on the dynamics of the physical system. We review existing studies on detecting cyber-physical attacks with various ML techniques from the perspectives of the physical system, the network, and the computing system. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions for ML-based cyber-physical security research in the context of real-time constraints, resiliency, and dataset generation to learn about the possible attacks. © 2021 by the authors.

This involves determining the direction and distance of the source of the sound. Some useful applications of this phenomenon exists in speech enhancement, communica-tion, radars and in the medical field as well. The experimental arrangement requires the use of microphone arrays which record the sound signal. Some methods involve using ad?hoc arrays of microphones because of their demonstrated advantages over other arrays. In this research project, the existing sound localization methods have been explored to analyze the advantages and disad-vantages of each method. A novel sound localization routine has been formulated which uses both the direction of arrival (DOA) of the sound signal along with the location estimation in three?di-mensional space to precisely locate a sound source. The experimental arrangement consists of four microphones and a single sound source. Previously, sound source has been localized using six or more microphones. The precision of sound localization has been demonstrated to increase with the use of more microphones. In this research, however, we minimized the use of microphones to re-duce the complexity of the algorithm and the computation time as well. The method results in nov-elty in the field of sound source localization by using less resources and providing results that are at par with the more complex methods requiring more microphones and additional tools to locate the sound source.

A major portion of the computing time is usually wasted on modeling and exploration of spaces that have a very low possibility of providing optimal/sub-optimal paths. However, computing time can be significantly reduced by searching for paths solely in the spaces that have the highest priority of providing an optimal/sub-optimal path. Many Path Planning (PP) techniques have been proposed, but a majority of the existing techniques equally evaluate many spaces of the maps, including unlikely ones, thereby creating time performance issues. Ignoring high-probability spaces and instead exploring too many spaces on maps while searching for a path yields extensive computing-time overhead. This paper presents a new PP method that finds optimal/quasi-optimal and safe (e.g., collision-free) working paths for UAVs in a 3D urban environment encompassing substantial obstacles. By using Constrained Polygonal Space (CPS) and an Extremely Sparse Waypoint Graph (ESWG) while searching for a path, the proposed PP method significantly lowers pathfinding time complexity without degrading the length of the path by much. We suggest an intelligent method exploiting obstacle geometry information to constrain the search space in a 3D polygon form from which a quasi-optimal flyable path can be found quickly. Furthermore, we perform task modeling with an ESWG using as few nodes and edges from the CPS as possible, and we find an abstract path that is subsequently improved. The results achieved from extensive experiments, and comparison with prior methods certify the efficacy of the proposed method and verify the above assertions. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the most significant technological evolvements during the 4th industrial revolution is Augmented Reality (AR) technology. AR superimposes interactional virtual objects/images to real environments. Because of the interaction and see-through characteristics, AR is better applied to engineering than Virtual Reality (VR). The application of AR in civil infrastructure can avoid artificial mistakes, improve efficiency, and saves budget. This article reviews AR applications in civil infrastructure, focusing on research studies in the latest five years (2016–2020) and their milestone developments. More than half of the AR research and implementation studies have focused on the construction domain in the last five years. Researchers deploy AR technologies in on-site construction to assist in discrepancy checking, collaborative communication, and safety checking. AR also uses building information models (BIMs) to produce detailed 3D structural information for visualization. Additionally, AR has been studied for structural health monitoring (SHM), routine and damage detection, energy performance assessment, crack inspection, excavation, and underground utility maintenance. Finally, AR has also been applied for architecture design, city plan, and disaster prediction as an essential part of smart city service.

This study examined whether monitoring both official and unofficial online news articles can improve influenza activity forecasting accuracy during influenza outbreaks. Data were retrieved from a Chinese commercial online platform and the website of the Chinese National Influenza Center. We modeled weekly fractions of influenza-related online news articles and compared them against weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) rates using autoregression analyses. We retrieved 153,958,695 and 149,822,871 online news articles focusing on the south and north of mainland China separately from 6 October 2019 to 17 May 2020. Our model based on online news articles could significantly improve the forecasting accuracy, compared to other influenza surveillance models based on historical ILI rates (p = 0.002 in the south; p = 0.000 in the north) or adding microblog data as an exogenous input (p = 0.029 in the south; p = 0.000 in the north). Our finding also showed that influenza forecasting based on online news articles could be 1–2 weeks ahead of official ILI surveillance reports. The results revealed that monitoring online news articles could sup-plement traditional influenza surveillance systems, improve resource allocation, and offer models for surveillance of other emerging diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

The research participants were IRE teachers who passed the 2019 In-service Teacher Profession Training Program at a State Islamic University in East Java, Indonesia. The mix-method research design with a qualitative-quantitative sequential exploratory analysis was used in this study. Qualitative data were obtained through telephone interviews, non-participant observations, and investigative documentary tracing, while quantitative data were obtained through a survey using online questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using the descriptive qualitative phenomenological technique and descriptive statistics. The findings show that the increase in the use of mobile learning by IRE teachers is an implication of the disruption leading to the mobilization of the educational sector to approach the Independent Learning policy based on performances in three perspectives. First, the policy is considered a critique of traditional educational practices. Second, the policy serves as a space for independence with rules and regulations that are more open for students and schools. Third, the policy is an effort to free education from social and political pressures and restraints. This study provides a new understanding of the philosophical inter-connection in teachers’ perceptions to the practice of distant learning implementation based on informational technology. © 2021, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

The quarantine was achieved successfully without any need for a national lockdown because, simply, Korean citizens actively followed quarantine guidelines. During the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, the country recognized the importance of an early response in the form of a systematic approach and adopted the necessary procedures. Comparing the spread of COVID-19 among different countries, Korea demonstrated several distinct characteristics. First, the duration of the coronavirus crisis was relatively short, and Korea was able to flatten the coronavirus curve in a brief period. Second, Korea blocked expanded transmission of the virus without implementing a national lockdown. Third, the coronavirus pandemic did not lead to economic panic. Korea, which had developed an institutional response to infectious diseases prior to COVID-19, used a strategy of balancing quarantine measures with economic policies. The paper summarizes the specific measures Korea implemented to overcome COVID-19, and discusses the sustainability of the economy after overcoming the virus. © 2020 by the Asian Economic Panel and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110768273

These issues indicate that there are gaps that need to be addressed, particularly the ones related to social aspects. In an attempt to fill in those gaps, this study aimed to identify the drivers of the adaptive capacity of an urban river neighbourhood community in Kg. Pertanian, Kulai, Johor. Data were elicited through focus group discussions with 27 residents followed by subsequent personal interviews. The obtained transcriptions were analysed by Nvivo12. From the results, it was found that there were three dominant drivers, namely 'community identity', 'community response', and 'stakeholder agency'. 'Community identity' refers to the community's contentment with life and its essential neighbourly relationships. 'Community response' reflects the community's process of learning from experience and how its residents used the knowledge to benefit the community's well-being. Finally, 'stakeholder agency' encompasses the community's engagement and communication with stakeholders to avoid conflict during upcoming planning for its urban river and neighbourhood. These drivers were based on the community' experiences or social memory. Interactions during floods and community events became the foundation for social memory. The interactions also bonded the people in the community, which was evident from the residents' participation. All in all, the adaptive capacity and consequently the resilience of the urban river neighbourhood community can be attributed to three drivers: 'community identity', 'community response', and 'stakeholder agency'. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press",Adaptive capacity; Community; Neighbourhood; Social memory; Urban river,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109271796

This paper is aimed at exploring how UPI is impacting, financial literacy, financial inclusion and the economic development of the poor in India. Structured equation modelling is applied in the paper to explore the path analysis of the relevant construct to establish the relationship. A structured questionnaire of interval scale was administered to gather the data for the study. It is found that UPI is impacting the financial literacy. In addition to that, it is found that financial literacy is significantly impacting financial inclusion which in turn is significantly causing economic development. Moreover, the significant association of financial literacy to financial inclusion is partially mediated by financial stability and the significant association of financial inclusion to economic development is also partially mediated by trust. The main implication of the study is that UPI is helping people in more than one way. It is not only supporting the financial literacy but also contributing to financial inclusion and economic development of the poor, indirectly. Therefore, policy makers can use the findings of this study to frame policies for UPI more effectively in the future. This study is unique as no other study is observed on the linkage of UPI with financial literacy, financial inclusion and economic development of the poor.

Primarily, 21 criteria were identified in five groups through the Delphi method at 30 m resolution, then criteria weights were obtained by DEMATEL and ANP, and the optimal fuzzy membership function was determined for each evaluation criterion. Combined with GIS spatial analysis and the clustering algorithm, candidate sites that satisfied the landfill conditions were identified, and the spatial distribution characteristics were analyzed. These sites were subsequently ranked utilizing the MOORA, WASPAS, COPRAS, and TOPSIS methods to verify the reliability of the results by conducting sensitivity analysis.

In this study we investigated the ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in categorizing histological images into different classes of retinal degeneration. Methods: Images were obtained from a chemically induced feline model of monocular retinal dystrophy and split into training and testing sets. The training set was graded for the level of retinal degeneration and used to train various CNN architectures. The testing set was evaluated through the best architecture and graded by six observers. Comparisons between model and observer classifications, and interobserver variability were measured. Finally, the effects of using less training images or images containing half the presentable context were investigated. Results: The best model gave weighted-F1 scores in the range 85% to 90%. Cohen kappa scores reached up to 0.86, indicating high agreement between the model and observers. Interobserver variability was consistent with the model-observer variability in the model’s ability to match predictions with the observers. Image context restriction resulted in model performance reduction by up to 6% and at least one training set size resulted in a model performance reduction of 10% compared to the original size. Conclusions: Detecting the presence and severity of up to three classes of retinal degeneration in histological data can be reliably achieved with a deep learning classifier. Translational Relevance: This work lays the foundations for future AI models which could aid in the evaluation of more intricate changes occurring in retinal degeneration, particularly in other types of clinically derived image data. © 2021 The Authors.",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining; Machine learning; Retinal degeneration; Retinal dystrophy; Retinitis pigmentosa,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108413618

Prediction models are used as decision-aid tools for electric grid operators to dynamically balance the energy production provided by a pool of diverse sources in the energy mix. However, different sources of uncertainty affect the predictions, providing the decision-makers with non-accurate and possibly misleading information for grid operation. In this regard, this work aims to quantify the possible sources of uncertainty that affect the predictions of wind energy production provided by an ensemble of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The proposed Bootstrap (BS) technique for uncertainty quantification relies on estimating Prediction Intervals (PIs) for a predefined confidence level. The capability of the proposed BS technique is verified, considering a 34 MW wind plant located in Italy. The obtained results show that the BS technique provides a more satisfactory quantification of the uncertainty of wind energy predictions than that of a technique adopted by the wind plant owner and the Mean-Variance Estimation (MVE) technique of literature. The PIs obtained by the BS technique are also analyzed in terms of different weather conditions experienced by the wind plant and time horizons of prediction. © 2021 by the authors.

It is therefore essential to provide a reference for making policy adjustments and transformations to promote the realization of SDGs in the post-pandemic era. Based on a literature review of the progress and policies of SDGs across countries worldwide, we find that research on sustainable policies has rapidly increased since the SDGs issued in 2015 with particular focuses on eco-environment, sustainable policies, green economy, sanitation and health, and water sanitation. Most countries are in the process of nationalization, institutionalization, and universalization of the SDGs through incorporating the SDGs into national development frameworks, enabling extensive participation and negotiation mechanisms, and promoting the SDGs’ national publicity. Countries of different economic and institutional backgrounds demonstrate divergent development pathways, priorities, measures, and progress in the implementation of SDGs. Despite significant global progress during the last five years, the North–South divide emerges in the policy action and achievement of SDGs. The least developed countries in sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia appear to be difficult or even unable to implement the SDGs and monitor the progress. In the post-pandemic era, particular attention shall be given to integrating SDGs and achieve synergy among goals, concretizing short-and medium-term priorities toward the SDGs targets for all countries, strengthening multilateralism and global cooperation among countries and continents, providing reliable data and approaches for real-time impact assessment and process monitoring, and promoting an inclusive engagement and integrative implementation with multiple stakeholders and consortiums. © 2021 by the authors.

However, to date, the essential rationale for, and analysis of, classical reversible computing (RC) has not yet been expressed in terms that leverage the modern formal methods of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics (NEQT). In this paper, we begin developing an NEQT-based foundation for the physics of reversible computing. We use the framework of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics (a.k.a. Lindbladians) with multiple asymptotic states, incorporating recent results from resource theory, full counting statistics and stochastic thermodynamics. Important conclusions include that, as expected: (1) Landauer’s Principle indeed sets a strict lower bound on entropy generation in traditional non-reversible architectures for deterministic computing machines when we account for the loss of correlations; and (2) implementations of the alternative reversible computation paradigm can potentially avoid such losses, and thereby circumvent the Landauer limit, potentially allowing the efficiency of future digital computing technologies to continue improving indefinitely. We also outline a research plan for identifying the fundamental minimum energy dissipation of reversible computing machines as a function of speed. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, the present systematic review delineated the contours of this growing research strand and analyzed how it relates to sustainability. A search performed on the Web of Science in January 2020 yielded 1389 documents, and 1289 were selected and underwent bibliometric and topical analyses. The topical analysis was informed by the SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems) approach of FAO and structured along four dimensions viz. environment, economy, society and culture, and policy and governance. The review shows an increasing interest in AFS with an exponential increase in publications number. However, the study field is north-biased and dominated by researchers and organizations from developed countries. Moreover, the analysis suggests that while environmental aspects are sufficiently addressed, social, economic, and political ones are generally overlooked. The paper ends by providing directions for future research and listing some topics to be integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary agenda addressing the multifaceted (un)sustainability of AFS.

However, the transient fault is an issue that must be addressed based on its effect that can lead to outages and short-circuits if prolonged. In this study, the authors summarize the guidelines and related standards of fault interaction associated with a monitoring system. The necessity of transient fault detection and location techniques and their limitations, the need for signal processing, as well as recommended practices, are also discussed in this paper. Some of the practices from local power utility are also shared, indicating the current approaches, key challenges, and the opportunities for improvement of fault-monitoring systems due to transient fault, which can be correlated with the reviews provided. © 2021 by the authors.

Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach, we find an inverted N?shaped relation between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in both the long? and short?run. The econometric results also reveal that energy consumption and urbanization statistically positively impact pollution. The long?run Granger causality test shows a unidirectional causality from energy consumption and economic growth to pollution while there is no causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. These suggest some crucial policies for curtailing emissions without harming economic development. In the second step, we also employed the back?propagation neural networks (BPN) to compare the work of econometrics in carbon dioxide emissions forecasting. A 5?4?1 multi?layer perceptron with BPN and learning rate was set at 0.1, which outperforms the ARDL’s outputs. Our findings suggest the potential application of machine learning to notably improve the econometric method’s forecasting results in the literature. © 2021 by the authors.

Not enough previous studies focus on the variation of SAH daily intensity. The purpose of this study is to establish a day-to-day prediction model of the SAH intensity, which can accurately predict not only the interannual variation but also the day-to-day variation of the SAH. Focusing on the summer period when the SAH is the strongest, this paper selects the geopotential height data between 1948 and 2020 from NCEP to construct the SAH intensity datasets. Compared with the classical deep learning methods of various kinds of efficient time series prediction model, we ultimately combine the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) method, which has the ability to deal with the nonlinear and unstable single system, with the Permutation Entropy (PE) method, which can extract the SAH intensity feature of IMF decomposed by CEEMDAN, and the Convolution-based Gated Recurrent Neural Network (ConvGRU) model is used to train, test, and predict the intensity of the SAH. The prediction results show that the combination of CEEMDAN and ConvGRU can have a higher accuracy and more stable prediction ability than the traditional deep learning model. After removing the redundant features in the time series, the prediction accuracy of the SAH intensity is higher than that of the classical model, which proves that the method has good applicability for the prediction of nonlinear systems in the atmosphere. © 2021 by the authors.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has been found capable of acquiring resistance to most antimicrobials. MRSA is ubiquitous and diverse even in terms of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, posing a challenge for treatment. Here, we present a comprehensive study of S. aureus in China, addressing epidemiology, phylogenetic reconstruction, genomic characterization, and identification of AMR profiles. The study analyzes 673 S. aureus isolates from food as well as from hospitalized and healthy individuals. The isolates have been collected over a 9-year period, between 2010 and 2018, from 27 provinces across China. By whole-genome sequencing, Bayesian divergence analysis, and supervised machine learning, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the isolates and compared them to references from other countries. We identified 72 sequence types (STs), of which, 29 were novel. We found 81 MRSA lineages by multilocus sequence type (MLST), spa, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec), and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) typing. In addition, novel variants of SCCmec type IV hosting extra metal and antimicrobial resistance genes, as well as a new SCCmec type, were found. New Bayesian dating of the split times of major clades showed that ST9, ST59, and ST239 in China and European countries fell in different branches, whereas this pattern was not observed for the ST398 clone. On the contrary, the clonal transmission of ST398 was more intermixed in regard to geographic origin. Finally, we identified genetic determinants of resistance to 10 antimicrobials, discriminating drug-resistant bacteria from susceptible strains in the cohort. Our results reveal the emergence of Chinese MRSA lineages enriched of AMR determinants that share similar genetic traits of antimicrobial resistance across human and food, hinting at a complex scenario of evolving transmission routes. © 2021 Wang et al.",Antimicrobial resistance; Bayesian divergence analysis; Foodborne pathogen; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); Staphylococcus aureus; Supervised machine learning; Whole-genome sequencing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107416578

The possibility of using them for forecasting phenomena occurring in nature, especially weather indicators, has been widely discussed. However, the various areas of the world differ in terms of their difficulty and ability in preparing accurate weather forecasts. Poland lies in a zone with a moderate transition climate, which is characterized by seasonality and the inflow of many types of air masses from different directions, which, combined with the compound terrain, causes climate variability and makes it difficult to accurately predict the weather. For this reason, it is necessary to adapt the model to the prediction of weather conditions and verify its effectiveness on real data. The principal aim of this study is to present the use of a regressive model based on a unidirectional multilayer neural network, also called a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to predict selected weather indicators for the city of Szczecin in Poland.

Taking advantage of recent advances in map application programming interfaces (APIs) and shared spatial data, this paper proposes new realistic sets of ACVRP benchmark instances. The spatial data of urban distribution centers, postal hubs, large shopping malls, residential complexes, restaurant businesses and convenience stores are used. To create distance and time matrices, the T map API, one of the most frequently used real time path analysis and distance measurement tools in Korea, is used. This paper also analyzes some important issues prevailing in urban transportation environments. These include the challenges of accounting for the frequency and distance in which air travel differs from reality when measuring closeness, the differences in distance and time for outgoing and return trips, and the rough conversion ratios from air distance to road distance and to road time. This paper contributes to the research community by providing more realistic ACVRP benchmark instances that reflect urban transportation environments. In addition, the cost matrix analyses provide insights into the behaviors of urban road networks. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The confluence of the two technologies has created many interesting and unique opportunities, but also left some issues in their wake. ML schemes have been extensively used to enhance the security and trust of embedded systems like hardware Trojans and malware detection. On the other hand, ML-based approaches have also been adopted by adversaries to assist side-channel attacks, reverse engineer integrated circuits and break hardware security primitives like Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Deep learning is a subfield of ML. It can continuously learn from a large amount of labeled data with a layered structure. Despite the impressive outcomes demonstrated by deep learning in many application scenarios, the dark side of it has not been fully exposed yet. The inability to fully understand and explain what has been done within the super-intelligence can turn an inherently benevolent system into malevolent. Recent research has revealed that the outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be easily corrupted by imperceptibly small input perturbations. As computations are brought nearer to the source of data creation, the attack surface of DNN has also been extended from the input data to the edge devices. Accordingly, due to the opportunities of ML-assisted security and the vulnerabilities of ML implementation, in this paper, we will survey the applications, vulnerabilities and fortification of ML from the perspective of hardware security. We will discuss the possible future research directions, and thereby, sharing a roadmap for the hardware security community in general. © 2011 IEEE.",adversarial examples; cloud FPGA; counterfeit IC; deep learning; edge AI; hardware security; hardware Trojan; Machine learning; malware detection; physical attacks; physically unclonable functions; side-channel attacks,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107184257

Sufficiently utilizing the information from Building Information Modeling (BIM), this framework automatically constructs geometry network model (GNM) through Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and integrates computer vision for indoor positioning. Considering the available local egress time (ALET), a back propagation (BP) neural network is applied for adjusting the rescue route according to the fire situation, improving the local safety performance of evacuation.

The increasing complexity of disasters and the expanding scope of non-military challenges call for an increased heterogeneity of core actors and for more participatory governance. Yet little is known about the patterns of stakeholder involvement in civil security across countries. Based on a comprehensive dataset covering 22 European countries, the article presents systematic evidence on the official involvement of different types of stakeholders in the national civil security governance systems. The goal is to explore whether the European countries with similar characteristics fall into geographically and culturally similar categories and whether similar patterns can be observed across the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region. The research questions addressed are: Do the European countries with similar characteristics fall into geographically and culturally similar categories ? Is the CEE region distinct from others ? To answer the questions, a hierarchical cluster analysis is conducted using security governance as a framework for analysis. The association is further tested between the different clusters of countries and broader cultural variables. The results suggest that despite sharing cultural similarities and geographical proximity, the CEE countries form mixed clusters with other non-CEE European countries. While the involvement of civil society organizations is quite universal, especially the involvement of private for-profit actors and multilateral engagement seem to discriminate among different types of civil security governance setup. © 2021 V?ra-Karin Brázová, published by Sciendo 2021.",Civil security; cluster analysis; comparative analysis; security governance; stakeholder involvement,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106567066

(2) What are the learner’s overall perceptions about their emotions during online video-based learning? This study was conducted with 26 Korean adult learners who took an online video lecture via an asynchronous self-directed mode. Their facial expressions during online learning were recorded and analyzed for detecting affective states. Two judges trained in Ekman’s Facial Action Coding System (FACS) analyzed 210 scenes segmented from the recorded video data using a retrospective affect judgment procedure. The analysis identified 101 incidences of boredom, 82 confusions, and 62 frustrations. Moreover, using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and hierarchical clustering, we identified some patterns of significant relationships between facial action units and affective states. The interview data reveal that the potential reasons for negative emotions include lack of concentration, uninteresting content, and one-way content delivery method.

Demand response strategies can reduce the time-of-use costs and overall electrical energy consumption. We present a method to reduce the electrical energy usage itself. Our novel heating schedule control minimises the electric water heater's energy usage without compromising user convenience. We achieve optimal control, while taking into account the natural temperature stratification of the water in the tank, using the A* search algorithm. Since previous research assumes a one-node thermal model, we also assess the effect of excluding stratification. We match three optimal control strategies to a baseline: the standard “always on” thermostat control. The first two strategies respectively match the temperature and the energy of the hot water supplied by the water heater. The third, a variation on the second, includes a method of preventing the growth of Legionella bacteria. We tested 77 water heaters over four weeks, a week for each season, and all three strategies saved energy. The median savings were 6.3% for temperature-matching, 21.9% for energy-matching and 16.2% for energy-matching with Legionella prevention.

The higher dimension of inherent information in the appearance model compared to the geometric model is problematic in many ways. However, due to the recent success of deep-learning-based methods, handling of high-dimensional appearance information becomes feasible. Among many deep neural networks, Siamese network with triplet loss has been widely adopted as an effective appearance feature extractor. Since the Siamese network can extract the features of each input independently, one can update and maintain target-specific features. However, it is not suitable for multi-target settings that require comparison with other inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel track appearance model based on the joint-inference network. The proposed method enables a comparison of two inputs to be used for adaptive appearance modeling and contributes to the disambiguation of target-observation matching and to the consolidation of identity consistency.

Accurate prediction of the number of dusty days (NDDs) in these areas is of great importance. The most popular method for predicting climatic and environmental variables is machine learning (ML). Although it has received more attention for spatial prediction, it has received less attention for the temporal prediction of these variables. This work is the first effort to predict NDDs in the major source of dust production in southeastern Iran using ML models and different feature selection (FS) techniques. For this purpose, monthly data of 21 predictor variables related to the study period (1988–2017) was used to predict the target variable (NDDs). The main aim was to evaluate the support vector machine (SVM), conditional inference random forest (CRF), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) models based on three FS algorithms, including Boruta, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) techniques in predicting NDDs around the Hamoun wetlands. After analyzing the collinearity effect and removing the independent variables with a Tolerance &lt; 0.11, the best attributes were selected to train the SVM, SGB, and CRF models. All datasets were randomly classified into training (70%) and verification (30%) sets. The performance of models was evaluated based on the determination coefficient (R-square), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient related to holdout data. The results indicated that SGB-MARS, SGB-RFE, and SGB-Boruta outperformed other models with different FS techniques, in terms of R2 (0.9), RMSE (2.5), MAE (1.9), and NSE (0.9). Furthermore, surface winds speed, maximum air temperature, relative humidity, wetland dried bed, and erosive winds frequency were detected as the most important factors for predicting NDDs in the study area. This study encourages us to use the SGB model with various FS techniques to predict NDDs around the desert wetlands. These results can help decision-makers reduce the risks of dust emission and increase the safety of residents around the desert wetlands. © 2021 The Author(s)",Boruta; Dust emissions; Hamoun wetlands; MARS; Multicollinearity; Recursive feature elimination; Stochastic gradient boosting,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101341557

On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond. In this work, we conduct a literature review of contact tracing methods and applications. Based on the literature review, we found limitations in gathering health data, such as insufficient network coverage. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID-19 analysis. Contact tracing applications must establish data collection and data interpretation. Intelligent data interpretation can assist epidemiological scientists in anticipating clusters, and can enable them to take necessary action in improving public health management. Our proposed tool could also be used to curb disease incidence in future global health crises. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",contact tracing; coronavirus disease; COVID-19; deep learning; digital tools; intelligent internet of things; wearable devices,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100881225

Major concerns over personal hygiene, mandated and ease in lockdown actions and slackening of some policy measures have led to a massive surge in the use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastic items. This generated an enormous amount of plastic waste from both healthcare and household units, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Apart from the healthcare workers, the general public have become accustomed to using PPE. These habits are threatening the land and marine environment with immense loads of plastic waste, due to improper disposal practices across the world, especially in developing nations. Contaminated PPE has already made its way to the oceans which will inevitably produce plastic particles alongside other pathogen-driven diseases. This study provided an estimation-based approach in quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of 3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations. Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and policy makers to design effective response plans. Sustainable plastic waste management for the current and post-pandemic period can be imagined and acted upon. © The Author(s) 2021.",Bangladesh; disposable facemask; Pandemic; personal protective equipment (PPE); plastic waste; SARS-CoV-2; single-use plastic,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099005987

Different from previous studies, which initiated Q-learning with zero or random Q values, this study initiates the Q-learning with different supervisory controls, and the detailed analysis is given. The results show that the proposed warm-start Q-learning requires 68.8% fewer iterations than cold-start Q-learning and improves 10%-16% MPG compared with equivalent consumption minimization strategy control.

To examine research advances and critical gaps, a review of the literature on coastal urban ecology was performed. Articles were selected following a structured decision tree and data were classified into study disciplines, approaches, type of analysis, main research objectives, and Pickett's paradigms in-, of-, and for- the city, among other categories. From a total of 237 publications, results show that most of the research comes from the USA, China, and Australia, and has been carried out mostly in large cities with populations between 1 and 5 million people. Focus has been placed on ecological studies, spatial and quantitative analysis and pollution in coastal urban areas. Most of the studies on urban ecology in coastal zones were developed at nearshore terrestrial environments and only 22.36% included the marine ecosystem. Urban ecological studies in coastal areas have mainly been carried out under the paradigm in the city with a focus on the disciplines of biology and ecology. Results suggest a series of disciplinary, geographical, and approach biases which can present a number of risks. Foremost among these is a lack of knowledge on social dimensions which can impact on sustainability. A key risk relates to the fact that lessons and recommendations of research are mainly from developed countries and large cities which might have different institutional, planning and cultural settings compared to developing and mid-income countries. Scientific research on coastal urban areas needs to diversify toward an ecology of and for the cities, in order to support coastal development in a diversity of countries and settings. © Copyright © 2021 Graells, Nakamura, Celis-Diez, Lagos, Marquet, Pliscoff and Gelcich.",coastal cities; coastal urban ecology; coastal urbanization; marine urbanization; urban ecology paradigms,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107568821

Given the variety of storage options that are becoming more and more economical, determining which type of storage technology to invest in, along with the appropriate timing and capacity becomes a critical research question. It is inevitable that these problems will continue to become increasingly relevant in the future and require strategic planning and holistic and modern frameworks in order to be solved. Reinforcement Learning algorithms have already proven to be successful in problems where sequential decision-making is inherent. In the operations planning area, these algorithms are already used but mostly in short-term problems with well-defined constraints. On the contrary, we expand and tailor these techniques to long-term planning by utilizing model-free algorithms combined with simulation-based models. A model and expansion plan have been developed to optimally determine microgrid designs as they evolve to dynamically react to changing conditions and to exploit energy storage capabilities. We show that it is possible to derive better engineering solutions that would point to the types of energy storage units which could be at the core of future microgrid applications. Another key finding is that the optimal storage capacity threshold for a system depends heavily on the price movements of the available storage units. By utilizing the proposed approaches, it is possible to model inherent problem uncertainties and optimize the whole streamline of sequential investment decision-making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Decision-making; Investment planning; Microgrids; Reinforcement learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103030080

To evaluate this impact more accurately, a quantitative analysis model based on multimeteorological factors and the Random Forest Regression model is proposed in this work. Firstly, an evaluation system is established to assess the impact. Then, to predict the indicators of the evaluation system, a parameter, i.e., performance ratio in sampling period, is defined. Secondly, a set of essential influences on the performance ratio in the sampling period is established through analyzing and reducing the discovered influences on the PV system performance. Finally, data from the Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre (DKASC) website are used to conduct the experiment. During the experiment, the sample set is cleaned using the model based on the cosine of the zenith angle. The functional relationship between the performance ratio in the sampling period and its essential influences is established through training a Random Forest Regression model with the data of the modeling system. The data of the test system are used to verify the forecast performance of the proposed model.

Machine learning models can emulate chemical transport models to provide computationally efficient predictions of outputs based on statistical associations with inputs. We developed novel emulators relating emission changes in five key anthropogenic sectors (residential, industry, land transport, agriculture, and power generation) to winter ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations across China. The emulators were optimized based on Gaussian process regressors with Matern kernels. The emulators predicted 99.9% of the variance in PM2.5 concentrations for a given input configuration of emission changes. PM2.5 concentrations are primarily sensitive to residential (51%–94% of first-order sensitivity index), industrial (7%–31%), and agricultural emissions (0%–24%). Sensitivities of PM2.5 concentrations to land transport and power generation emissions are all under 5%, except in South West China where land transport emissions contributed 13%. The largest reduction in winter PM2.5 exposure for changes in the five emission sectors is by 68%–81%, down to 15.3–25.9 ?g m?3, remaining above the World Health Organization annual guideline of 10 ?g m?3. The greatest reductions in PM2.5 exposure are driven by reducing residential and industrial emissions, emphasizing the importance of emission reductions in these key sectors. We show that the annual National Air Quality Target of 35 ?g m?3 is unlikely to be achieved during winter without strong emission reductions from the residential and industrial sectors. © 2021.

However, previous studies have focused more on the use of single data sources, such as AIS (Automatic Information System) and VBD (VIIRS boat detection), to obtain fishing intensity information and, as such, have encountered some problems, such as insufficient comprehensive data coverage for ships, non-uniform spatial distribution of data signal acquisition, and insufficient accuracy in obtaining fishing intensity information. The development of big data and remote sensing Earth observation technology has provided abundant data sources and technical support for the acquisition of fishing intensity data for marine fisheries. Based on this situation, this paper proposes a framework that integrates the data of fishing vessels from two sources (AIS, with high space-time granularity, and VBD, with short revisit cycle and high sensitivity), in order to obtain such information based on closely matching and fusing the vector point data of ship positions. With the help of this framework and the strategy of indirectly representing fishing intensity by data point density after fusion, the spatial characteristics and rules of fishing intensity in typical seasons (February, April, September, and November) in the northern South China Sea in 2018 were systematically analyzed and investigated. The results revealed the following: (1) Matching and fusing AIS and VBD data can provide a better perspective to produce robust and accurate marine fishery intensity data. The two types of data have a low proximity match rate (approximately 1.89% and 6.73% of their respective inputs) and the matching success for fishing vessels in the data was 49.42%. (2) Single AIS data can be used for nearshore (50 to 70 km) marine fishery analysis research, while VBD data reflect the objective marine fishing in space, showing obvious complementarity with AIS. (3) The fishing intensity grid data obtained from the integrated data show that high-intensity fishing in the study area was concentrated in the coastal area of Maoming City, Guangdong (0-50 km); the coastal area of Guangxi Beihai (10-70 km); around Hainan Island in Zhangzhou (10-30 km); and the Sanya nearshore area (0-50 km). However, it did not decay with increasing offshore distance, such as at the Trans-Vietnamese boundary in the Beibu Gulf, near the China-Vietnam Common Fisheries Area (50 km) and high-intensity fishing areas. (4) The obtained fishing intensity data (AIS, VBD, and AIS + VBD) were quantitatively analyzed, showing that the CV (Coefficient of Variation) of the average for each month (after fusing the two types of data) was 0.995, indicating that the distribution of the combined data was better than that before fusion (before fusion: AIS = 0.879, VBD = 1.642). Therefore, the integration of AIS and VBD can meet the need for a more effective, comprehensive, and accurate fishing intensity analysis in marine fishery resources. © 2021 by the authors.",AIS; Data fusion; Fishing intensity; Geographic data; Marine fisheries sustainable; Northern south china sea; VBD,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106702792

This study investigated the farmland loss due to urbanization in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China from 1980 to 2018 based on multiperiod datasets from the Land Use and Land Cover of China databases. Then, we calculated ecosystem service values (ESVs) of farmland using valuation methods to estimate the ecosystem service variations caused by urbanization in the study area. The results showed that 3711.3 km2 of farmland disappeared because of urbanization, and paddy fields suffered much higher losses than dry farmland. Most of the farmland was converted to urban residential land from 1980 to 2018. In the past 38 years, the ESV of farmland decreased by 5036.7 million yuan due to urbanization, with the highest loss of 2177.5 million yuan from 2000–2010. The hydrological regulation, food production and gas regulation of farmland decreased the most due to urbanization. The top five cities that had the largest total ESV loss of farmland caused by urbanization were Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Shenzhen and Huizhou. This study revealed that urbanization has increasingly become the dominant reason for farmland loss in the GBA. Our study suggests that governments should increase the construction of ecological cities and attractive countryside to protect farmland and improve the regional ESV. © 2021 by the authors.

The use of machine learning algorithms and panel data analysis offered the possibility to determine the importance of the input variables by applying three algorithms (Random forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost) and then by modeling the urbanization and the impact of energy intensity on the carbon emissions. The empirical results confirm the relationship between urbanization and energy intensity on CO2 emissions. The findings emphasize that separate components of energy consumption affect carbon emissions and, therefore, a transition toward renewable sources for energy needs is desirable. The models from the current study confirm previous studies’ observations made for other countries and regions. Urbanization, as a process, has an influence on the carbon emissions more than the actual urban regions do, confirming that all the activities carried out as urbanization efforts are more harmful than the resulted urban area. It is proper to say that the urban areas tend to embrace modern, more green technologies but the road to achieve environmentally friendly urban areas is accompanied by less environmentally friendly industries (such as the cement industry) and a high consumption of nonrenewable energy. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy can be extremely volatile as they are weather dependent. These resources coupled with demand can lead to random variations on both the generation and load sides, thus complicating optimal energy management. In this article, a reinforcement learning approach has been proposed to deal with this non-stationary scenario, in which the energy management system (EMS) is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP). A novel modification of the control problem has been presented that improves the use of energy stored in the battery such that the dynamic demand is not subjected to future high grid tariffs. A comprehensive reward function has also been developed which decreases infeasible action explorations thus improving the performance of the data-driven technique. A Q-learning algorithm is then proposed to minimize the operational cost of the microgrid under unknown future information. To assess the performance of the proposed EMS, a comparison study between a trading EMS model and a non-trading case is performed using a typical commercial load curve and PV profile over a 24-h horizon. Numerical simulation results indicate that the agent learns to select an optimized energy schedule that minimizes energy cost (cost of power purchased from the utility and battery wear cost) in all the studied cases. However, comparing the non-trading EMS to the trading EMS model operational costs, the latter one was found to decrease costs by 4.033% in summer season and 2.199% in winter season. © 2021 by the authors.

CRIMSON provides a powerful, customizable and user-friendly system for performing three-dimensional and reduced-order computational haemodynamics studies via a pipeline which involves: 1) segmenting vascular structures from medical images; 2) constructing analytic arterial and venous geometric models; 3) performing finite element mesh generation; 4) designing, and 5) applying boundary conditions; 6) running incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of blood flow with fluid-structure interaction capabilities; and 7) post-processing and visualizing the results, including velocity, pressure and wall shear stress fields. A key aim of CRIMSON is to create a software environment that makes powerful computational haemodynamics tools accessible to a wide audience, including clinicians and students, both within our research laboratories and throughout the community. The overall philosophy is to leverage best-in-class open source standards for medical image processing, parallel flow computation, geometric solid modelling, data assimilation, and mesh generation. It is actively used by researchers in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia.

However, it is difficult to accurately predict air temperature due to its non-linear and chaotic nature. Several deep learning techniques have been proposed over the last few decades to forecast air temperature. This study provides a comprehensive review of artificial neural network (ANN)-based approaches (such as recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), etc.), which were used to forecast air temperature. The focus is on the works during 2005–2020. The review shows that the neural network models can be employed as promising tools to forecast air temperature. Although the ANN-based approaches have been utilized widely to predict air temperature due to their fast computing speed and ability to deal with complex problems, no consensus yet exists on the best existing method. Additionally, it is found that the ANN methods are mainly viable for short-term air temperature forecasting. Finally, some future directions and recommendations are presented. © 2021 by the authors.

Visibility was predicted and evaluated using a training set for the period 2017–2018 and a test set for 2019. VISRF results were compared and analyzed using visibility data from the ASOS (VISASOS) and the Unified Model (UM) Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) (VISLDAPS ) operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).

Based on these comparisons, the applied RF model offers significantly better predictive performance and more accurate visibility data (VISRF) than the currently available VISLDAPS outputs.

That is, where energy efficiency becomes a critical factor for fueling innovation. This impact can occur within a company, a region, a nation or on an international level. Here we show that regions could motivate business innovations through policies requiring energy efficiency. Based on observations from a number of regions of an emerging economy, we show that energy efficiency impacts innovation. As a side effect it can contribute to export increases, which in turn can improve regional attractiveness for investors.

(2) The spatiotemporal distribution of Chl-a in Qinzhou Bay is varied, with lower concentrations (0.50 µg/L) observed near the shore and higher concentrations (6.70 µg/L) observed offshore, with a gradual decreasing trend over time (?0.8). © 2021 by the authors.

Localization is one of the most attractive applications related to IoT. In the past few years, localization has been gaining attention because of its applicability in safety, health monitoring, environment monitoring, and security. As a result, various localization-based wireless frameworks are being presented to improve such applications’ performances based on specific key performance indicators (KPIs). Therefore, this paper explores the recently proposed localization schemes in IoT. Initially, this paper explains the major KPIs of localization. After that, a thorough comparison of recently proposed localization schemes based on the KPIs is presented. The comparison includes an overview, architecture, network structure, performance parameters, and target KPIs.

Lockdowns, physical spacing, transport restrictions and stay-at-home guidelines have transformed personal mobility and highlighted the mistakes of an unbalanced pro-car culture that defined a century of urban planning. One immediate effect of the virus in relation to travel demand and supply was the emergence of active travel modes because of their unique ability to provide a socially distanced way of transport. Cycling is one of the modes that has enjoyed significant attention. Numerous cities have reallocated street and public space to cyclists and introduced pro-bike interventions like pop-up cycle lanes, e-bike subsidies, free bike-share use and traffic calming measures. This newly found outbreak-induced momentum creates an opportunity to establish a new ethos that allows the promotion of potentially permanent strategies that may help cycling to be (re-)established as a robust, mainstream and resilient travel mode for inner city trips and not as a second-class alternative operating under the automobile’s giant shadow. This paper provides a state-of-the-art description of the anti-COVID cycling-friendly initiatives that have been introduced globally, the successes and failures of these initiatives, the lessons learnt that can help us redefine the bicycle’s role in local societies today and a best cycling practice policy guide for planning a more bike-centric future. © 2021 by the authors.

However high-frequency bands do not cover larger distances. The coverage problem is addressed by using a heterogeneous network which comprises numerous small and macrocells, defined by transmission and reception points (TRxPs). For such a network, random access is considered a challenging function in which users attempt to select an efficient TRxP by random access within a given time. Ideally, an efficient TRxP is less congested, minimizing delays in users’ random access. However, owing to the nature of random access, it is not feasible to deploy a centralized controller estimating the congestion level of each cell and deliver this information back to users during random access. To solve this problem, we establish an optimization problem and employ a reinforcement-learning-based scheme. The proposed scheme estimates congestion of TRxPs in service and selects the optimal access point. Mathematically, this approach is beneficial in approximating and minimizing a random access delay function. Through simulation, we demonstrate that our proposed deep learning-based algorithm improves performance on random access. Notably, the average access delay is improved by 58.89% from the original 3GPP algorithm, and the probability of successful access also improved. © 2021 by the authors.

Each and every human has a unique gait and prior works suggest WiFi devices are able to capture the unique signature of a person's gait. In this article, we show for the first time that the monitored gait could be inconsistent and have mirror-like perturbations when individuals walk through WiFi devices in different directions, provided that the WiFi antenna array is horizontal to the walking path. Such inconsistent mirrored patterns are to negatively affect the uniqueness of gait and accuracy of human identification. Therefore, we propose a system called Gate-ID for accurately identifying individuals' identities irrespective of different walking directions. Gate-ID employs theoretical communication model and real measurements to demonstrate that antenna array orientations and walking directions contribute to the mirror-like patterns in WiFi signals. A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to infer individual's walking directions. A set of methods are employed to extract and augment the representative spatial-temporal features of gait and enable the system performing irrespective of walking directions. We further propose a novel attention-based deep learning model that fuses various weighted features and ignores ineffective noises to uniquely identify individuals. We implement Gate-ID on commercial off-the-shelf devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can uniquely identify people with average accuracy of 90.7%-75.7% from a group of 6-20 people, respectively, and improve the accuracy by 12.5%-43.5% compared with baselines. © 2014 IEEE.",Channel state information (CSI); human identification; neural networks; WiFi,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104872436

Yet, biogeographers have not determined whether these floras represent evolutionarily independent but convergent assemblages drawn from their regional floras, or whether they originated from particular clades pre-adapted to harsh conditions. Here, we analyse the evolutionary relationships of angiosperm (flowering plant) species in 63 alpine floras worldwide (~7,000 species) in comparison with their regional floras (~94,000 species) and with the entire global flora. We find that each of the alpine floras represents an assemblage of more closely related species than their respective regional floras. The degree of phylogenetic clustering of species in alpine floras in tropical mountains exceeds that in temperate mountains. However, in relation to the global flora, temperate alpine floras are phylogenetically closely related subsets of floras that colonized cold temperate areas during interglacial periods. We conclude that alpine floras include a few dominant families that have evolved tolerance to low temperature, and that evolutionary niche conservatism explains their phylogenetic clustering, compared with species in their regional species pools. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103382457

Many previous studies relied on interviews and/or questionnaire to assess physical fatigue in construction workers. However, these traditional methods are not only time-consuming but also limited by recall bias. To overcome these limitations, many researchers have used physiological metrics (e.g., heart rate, heart-rate variability, skin temperature, electromyographic activity, and jerk metrics) to measure real-time physical fatigue. Although physiological metrics have shown promising results for real-time assessments of physical fatigue, no state-of-the-art review has been conducted to summarize various physiological metrics in measuring physical fatigue among construction workers.

Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to May 11, 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that ~28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and ~184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by ~37 (?g/m3), 62 (?g/m3), and 145 (?g/m3), respectively. A total of ~1310, ~401, and ~430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as ~10, ~3.1, and ~3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detailed spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed.

Resources are increasingly interlinked, and competing users may define a resource and its boundaries differently. At times, resource units are confined into “resource plots”, while at other times they are “resource stocks”. Nevertheless, according to Elinor Ostrom, “clearly defined boundaries” are an important design principle. Against this background, the aim of this article is to develop, based on the work of Achille Varzi, an analytical framework with the help of which a better understanding can be gained of boundaries and their ambiguities in CPR management. Applied to 33 publications from Elinor Ostrom, the framework shows that focus has been on spatial, social boundaries. Less attention has been paid to natural boundaries, and in particular to natural resource limits. Applied to three empirical cases from East Asia, the framework shows how a more nuanced understanding of boundaries and their ambiguities can inform environmental management on the role of ambiguity. On a theoretical level, the paper finds that we need to move away from understanding a resource as a plain landscape, to a landscape as composed of shifting equilibria of resource flows, the limits of which need to be incorporated in CPR management. © 2021 The Author(s)",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101411976

CRFF incorporates cross-correlation analysis (CCA), random forest (RF), and factorial analysis (FA) within a general framework. CRFF can identify the time lag effect in the runoff mechanism (both rainfall and glacier/snow meltwater), tackle the problem of the simulation performance degradation caused by the time lag effect, as well as investigate the individual and interactive effects of meteorological and physical factors on runoff simulation. CRFF is applied to the Amu Darya River Basin (ADRB), a typical mountainous watershed in Central Asia. Bayesian neural network (BNN) and stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) are used for illustrating the advantage of RF in streamflow simulation. The main findings reveal that (i) compared with BNN and SCA, RF has the better simulation capacity; (ii) the time lag effect of heat conditions such as temperature (T) and shortwave radiation (SWR) is weak, with the lag time being less than 30 days; the time lag effect of the precipitation conditions such as snow precipitation rate (SPR) is strong, with a lag time ranging from 30 days to 90 days; (iii) in snow-melting, non-melting and entire periods, T has the dominant impact on the variation of the runoff in ADRB; (iv) the interaction of T and SWR has important effect on the streamflow; SPR can still considerably affect the runoff generation in non-melting period. © 2021 The Authors",Amu Darya River Basin; Cross-correlation analysis; Factorial analysis; Interactive effect; Random forest; Streamflow simulation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101321335

These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management across energy vectors), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within the SLES boundary and to the wider system. However, there may be trade-offs between outcomes due to pressures for change originating from competing actors (e.g. landscape vs. incumbents in the regime); understanding the mapping between different outcomes, SLES elements and their interconnections will be key to unlocking wider benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Community energy; Decentralised energy; Energy democratisation; Energy transition; Expert interviews; Meta-narrative review; Smart cities; Smart local energy systems,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100414145

As remedies, a number of defense methods were proposed, which however, have been circumvented by newer and more sophisticated attacking strategies. In the midst of this ensuing arms race, the problem of robustness against adversarial attacks still remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel, simple yet effective defense strategy where off-manifold adversarial samples are driven towards high density regions of the data generating distribution of the (unknown) target class by the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) with perceptual boundary taken into account. To achieve this task, we introduce a generative model of the conditional distribution of the inputs given labels that can be learned through a supervised Denoising Autoencoder (sDAE) in alignment with a discriminative classifier. Our algorithm, called MALA for DEfense (MALADE), is equipped with significant dispersion—projection is distributed broadly. This prevents white box attacks from accurately aligning the input to create an adversarial sample effectively. MALADE is applicable to any existing classifier, providing robust defense as well as off-manifold sample detection. In our experiments, MALADE exhibited state-of-the-art performance against various elaborate attacking strategies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Adversarial examples; Langevin dynamics; Robustness,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100149772

Increased host temperature creates hotspots which significantly increases cooling cost and affects reliability. Accurate prediction of host temperature is crucial for managing the resources effectively. Temperature estimation is a non-trivial problem due to thermal variations in the data center. Existing solutions for temperature estimation are inefficient due to their computational complexity and lack of accurate prediction. However, data-driven machine learning methods for temperature prediction is a promising approach. In this regard, we collect and study data from a private cloud and show the presence of thermal variations. We investigate several machine learning models to accurately predict the host temperature. Specifically, we propose a gradient boosting machine learning model for temperature prediction. The experiment results show that our model accurately predicts the temperature with the average RMSE value of 0.05 or an average prediction error of 2.38 °C, which is 6 °C less as compared to an existing theoretical model. In addition, we propose a dynamic scheduling algorithm to minimize the peak temperature of hosts. The results show that our algorithm reduces the peak temperature by 6.5 °C and consumes 34.5 percent less energy as compared to the baseline algorithm. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",Cloud computing; datacenter cooling; energy efficiency in a data center; hotspots; machine learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097931190

Presently, discussions are mostly concerned with the importance of achieving CE and the benefits associated therewith, with the various barriers surrounding its implementation being less debated. Understanding the context in which circularity can flourish is a prerequisite in building the capabilities to deal with the multi-faceted challenges that currently hamper progress in closing the material, component and product loops. In this study, we discuss the importance of systems thinking in understanding the way resource recovery systems operate, and in promoting deep transformational change. We suggest that transformational change needs to go beyond closing materials, components and products (MCPs) loops, and promote sustainability in the way resources are exploited, used and managed throughout the system. By adopting a system of systems approach, we postulate that there are five interconnected sub-systems that need to be considered for supporting transitions to CE, namely, resource flows and provisioning service; governance, regulatory framework and political landscape; business activities and the marker; infrastructure and innovation; and user practices. This holistic approach provides a useful means to cutting through systemic complexity, and focuses on the dynamics between processes, values and actors in the value chain, and their dependence on cultural, spatial and temporal characteristics. We conclude that a systems-based approach can build up the capabilities required to identify and understand persistent linear trends and, in turn, support forward-thinking and time investment in enabling sustainable transitions. This, in turn, can help to align priorities and transform our current practices, speeding up the process of closing the MCP loops in a sustainable manner.

By learning the shape correspondences between pairs of layout design patterns and their scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the product wafer thereof, given an IC layout pattern, LithoNet can mimic the fabrication process to predict its fabricated circuit shape. Furthermore, LithoNet can take the wafer fabrication parameters as a latent vector to model the parametric product variations that can be inspected on SEM images. Besides, traditional optical proximity correction (OPC) methods used to suggest a correction on a lithographic photomask is computationally expensive. Our proposed OPCNet mimics the OPC procedure and efficiently generates a corrected photomask by collaborating with LithoNet to examine if the shape of a fabricated circuit optimally matches its original layout design. As a result, the proposed LithoNet-OPCNet framework can not only predict the shape of a fabricated IC from its layout pattern but also suggests a layout correction according to the consistency between the predicted shape and the given layout.

Whereas classical governance typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational components that are modular and composable, highly versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another, and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a ubiquitous network layer.

This creates significant novel challenges for Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) such as volatile net demand behavior and predicting Low Voltage (LV) demand. There is a lack of understanding of modern LV networks’ demand and renewable energy sources behavior. This article starts with an investigation into the unique characteristics of householder demand behavior in Jordan, connected to Photovoltaics (PV) systems. Previous studies have focused mostly on forecasting LV level demand without considering renewable energy sources, disaggregation demand and the weather conditions at the LV level. In this study, we provide detailed LV demand analysis and a variety of forecasting methods in terms of a probabilistic, new optimization learning algorithm called the Golden Ratio Optimization Method (GROM) for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for rolling and point forecasting. Short-term forecasting models have been designed and developed to generate future scenarios for different disaggregation demand levels from households, small cities, net demands and PV system output. The results show that the volatile behavior of LV networks connected to the PV system creates substantial forecasting challenges.

Higher education plays a key role in promoting sustainable development initiatives and in empowering people to change their thinking and to strive for a sustainable future. However, the main issue that needs to be presently resolved is how leaders, teachers, and students in higher education can achieve sustainable development in their system vision, mission and values, strategic plans, and organizational culture. Morocco is a country with a long history of higher education and has continuous reforms for sustainable development. In the process of responding to the wave of globalization, the Moroccan government has begun to formulate a higher education reform plan to maintain its competitiveness and achieve the SDG standards. Therefore, this study is focused on the quality of the higher education system through which the sustainability of higher education reform can be implemented. With this in mind, an organized approach that involved a questionnaire using the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) decision-making model with integration of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Entropy method was developed. The questionnaires were filled out by the experts, staff, and students of the higher education system (universities) to obtain the important key factors for the SWOT analysis. The AHP was used for the qualitative analysis of the weights of the SWOT factors, while the Entropy method was applied for the objective analysis of the number of different weight attributes. After integration of AHP with Entropy, the finalized variables were ranked; these results are more reliable and realistic to decision-makers.

As biometric data leakage may cause stringent privacy issues, many proposals have been offered to guarantee the security of stored biometric data, i.e., biometric template. One of the most promising solutions is the use of a remote server that stores the template in an encrypted form and performs a biometric comparison on the ciphertext domain, using recently proposed functional encryption (FE) techniques. However, the drawback of this approach is that considerable computation is required for the inner-pairing product operation used for the decryption procedure of the underlying FE, which is performed in the authentication phase. In this paper, we propose an enhanced method to accelerate the inner-pairing product computation and apply it to expedite the decryption operation of FE and for faster remote biometric verification. The following two important observations are the basis for our improvement—one of the two arguments for the decryption operation does not frequently change over authentication sessions, and we only need to evaluate the product of multiple pairings, rather than individual pairings. From the results of our experiments, the proposed method reduces the time required to compute an inner-pairing product by 30.7%, compared to the previous best method. With this improvement, the time required for biometric verification is expected to decrease by up to 10.0%, compared to a naive method. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposed a computerized process of classifying skin disease through deep learning-based MobileNet V2 and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The MobileNet V2 model proved to be efficient with a better accuracy that can work on lightweight computational devices. The proposed model is efficient in maintaining stateful information for precise predictions. A grey-level co-occurrence matrix is used for assessing the progress of diseased growth. The performance has been compared against other state-of-the-art models such as Fine-Tuned Neural Networks (FTNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition developed by Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and convolutional neural network architecture that expanded with few changes. The HAM10000 dataset is used and the proposed method has outperformed other methods with more than 85% accuracy. Its robustness in recognizing the affected region much faster with almost 2x lesser computations than the conven-tional MobileNet model results in minimal computational efforts. Furthermore, a mobile application is designed for instant and proper action. It helps the patient and dermatologists identify the type of disease from the affected region’s image at the initial stage of the skin disease. These findings suggest that the proposed system can help general practitioners efficiently and effectively diagnose skin conditions, thereby reducing further complications and morbidity. © 2021 by the authors.

These developments and research trends address challenges such as heterogeneous communication, quality of service requirements, unpredictable network conditions, and a massive influx of data. One major contribution to the research world is in the form of software-defined networking applications, which aim to deploy rule-based management to control and add intelligence to the network using high-level policies to have integral control of the network without knowing issues related to low-level configurations. Machine learning techniques coupled with software-defined networking can make the networking decision more intelligent and robust. The Internet of Things application has recently adopted virtualization of resources and network control with software-defined networking policies to make the traffic more controlled and maintainable. However, the requirements of software-defined networking and the Internet of Things must be aligned to make the adaptations possible. This paper aims to discuss the possible ways to make software-defined networking enabled Internet of Things application and discusses the challenges solved using the Internet of Things leveraging the software-defined network. We provide a topical survey of the application and impact of software-defined networking on the Internet of things networks. We also study the impact of machine learning techniques applied to software-defined networking and its application perspective. The study is carried out from the different perspectives of software-based Internet of Things networks, including wide-area networks, edge networks, and access networks. Machine learning techniques are presented from the perspective of network resources management, security, classification of traffic, quality of experience, and quality of service prediction.

Background Despite the enormous potential of wearable payments, studies investigating the adoption of this technology are scarce. Methodology This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with four addi-tional variables (Perceived Security, Trust, Perceived Cost, and Attractiveness of Alternatives) to investigate behavioral intentions to adopt wearable payments. The moderating role of gender was also examined. Data collected from 311 Kuwaiti respondents were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA). Contribution The research model provided in this study may be useful for academics and scholars conducting further research into m-payments adoption, specifically in the case of wearable payments where studies are scarce and still in the nascent stage; hence, addressing the gap in existing literature. Further, this study is the first to have specifically investigated wearable payments in the State of Kuwait; therefore, enriching Kuwaiti context literature. Findings This study empirically demonstrated that behavioral intention to adopt wearable payments is mainly predicted by attractiveness of alternatives, perceived useful-ness, perceived ease of use, perceived security and trust, while the role of per-ceived cost was found to be insignificant. Recommendations for Practitioners This study draws attention to the importance of cognitive factors, such as per-ceived usefulness and ease of use, in inducing users' behavioral intention to adopt wearable payments. As such, in the case of perceived usefulness, smart wearable devices manufacturers and banks enhance the functionalities and fea-tures of these devices, expand on the financial services provided through them, and maintain the availability, performance, effectiveness, and efficiency of these tools. In relation to ease of use, smart wearable devices should be designed with an easy to use, high quality and customizable user interface. The findings of this study demonstrated the influence of trust and perceived security in motivating users to adopt wearable payments, Hence, banks are advised to focus on a rela-tionship based on trust, especially during the early stages of acceptance and adoption of wearable payments. Recommendations for Researchers The current study validated the role of attractiveness of alternatives, which was never examined in the context of wearable payments. This, in turn, provides a new dimension about a determinant factor considered by customers in predict-ing their behavioral intention to adopt wearable payments. Impact on Society This study could be used in other countries to compare and verify the results. Additionally, the research model of this study could also be used to investigate other m-payments methods, such as m-wallets and P2P payments. Future Research Future studies should investigate the proposed model in a cross-country and cross-cultural perspective with additional economic, environmental, and techno-logical factors. Also, future research may conduct a longitudinal study to explain how temporal changes and usage experience affect users' behavioral intentions to adopt wearable payments. Finally, while this study included both influencing factors and inhibiting factors, other factors such as social influence, perceived compatibility, personal innovativeness, mobility, and customization could be considered in future research. © 2021 Informing Science Institute.

This study evaluates the primary causal factors for occurrence of springs. The data used in this study consists of 20 parameters based on topography, geology, lithology, hydrology and land use as causal factors, whereas 621 spring location and discharge (n ¼ 621) measured during 2014-2016 and 815 non-spring locations (generated by GIS tool) use as supporting evidence to train (80%) and test (20%) the prediction model. Results show that the Bootstrap method is comparatively reliable (92% accuracy) over Boosted tree (64% accuracy) and Decision tree (74% accuracy) methods to classify and predict the occurrence of springs in the watershed. Bootstrap Forest shows the high Prediction rate for True Positive (82% actual spring predicted as a spring) and True Negative (89% actual non-spring predicted as non-spring), and the model seems consistent in both responses. This model was then applied to an independent dataset to predict spring location estimates with 75% accuracy. Therefore, spatial statistical methods prove efficient at predicting spring occurrence in data poor regions. © 2021 IWA Publishing.

The lessons that have been learned from good practices by various countries include containing the virus rapidly; enforcing containment measures; growing COVID-19 testing capability; discovering cures; providing stimulus packages to the affected; easing monetary policies; developing new pandemic-related industries; support plans for controlling unemployment; and overcoming inequalities. Coordination and multi-term planning have been found to be the key among the successful national and global endeavors to fight the pandemic. The current research and practice have mainly focused on specific aspects of COVID-19 response. There is a need to automate the learning process such that we can learn from good and bad practices during pandemics and normal times. To this end, this paper proposes a technology-driven framework, iResponse, for coordinated and autonomous pandemic management, allowing pandemic-related monitoring and policy enforcement, resource planning and provisioning, and data-driven planning and decision-making. The framework consists of five modules: Monitoring and Break-the-Chain, Cure Development and Treatment, Resource Planner, Data Analytics and Decision Making, and Data Storage and Management. All modules collaborate dynamically to make coordinated and informed decisions. We provide the technical system architecture of a system based on the proposed iResponse framework along with the design details of each of its five components. The challenges related to the design of the individual modules and the whole system are discussed. We provide six case studies in the paper to elaborate on the different functionalities of the iResponse framework and how the framework can be implemented. These include a sentiment analysis case study, a case study on the recognition of human activities, and four case studies using deep learning and other data-driven methods to show how to develop sustainability-related optimal strategies for pandemic management using seven real-world datasets.

But after 1990, with more fertilizer N consumption in developing countries especially in East and South Asia than in the industrialized nations in North America and Europe, nitrate pollution of freshwaters is now increasingly becoming a pervasive global problem. In this review it has been attempted to review the research information generated during the last two decades from all over the world on different aspects of nitrate pollution of natural water bodies. It is now evident that not more than 50% of the fertilizer N is directly used by the crops to which it is applied. While a small portion may directly leach down and may reach ground and surface water bodies, a large proportion ends up in the soil organic N pool from where N is mineralized and is taken up by plants and/or lost via leaching during several decades. Present trends of nitrate pollution of freshwaters, therefore, reflect legacies of current and past applications of fertilizers and manures. Tools such as simulation models and the natural variation in the stable isotopes of N and oxygen are now being extensively used to study the contribution of fertilizers and other sources to nitrate enrichment of freshwaters. Impacts of agricultural stewardship measures are being assessed and nitrate enrichment of water bodies is being managed using modern digital models and frameworks. Improved water and fertilizer management in agroecosystems can reduce the contribution of fertilizers to nitrate pollution of water bodies but a host of factors determine the magnitude.

First, what kind of actions help in avoiding, shifting and improving demand for activities/services and resultant emissions to help in deciding choices for actions; second, how these three categories of actions are linked to the wider impact on human wellbeing represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework; and third, who are the actors associated with these mitigation actions. These three steps become important in the targeted scaling up of actions through policy interventions. This study undertakes a review of the literature between 2015 and 2020 with systematic evidence searching and screening. The literature search has been conducted in Scopus Database. From over 6887 literature in the initial search, 294 relevant literature were finally reviewed to link demand side interventions of avoid-shift-improve (ASI) categories to SDGs. It also maps these actions to actors who can lead the changes. Results show that a wide range of improvement actions are already helping in incremental steps to reduce demand and emissions in various services like mobility, shelter and industrial products. However, ASI categories provide more distinct mitigation actions. All actions need support of innovation, infrastructure development and industrialization. Actions that interact with several SDGs include active mode of transport, passive building design, cleaner cooking, and circular economy. Positive links of these actions to multiple SDGs are overall very strong; however, few trade-offs have been observed. These are mostly related to distributional impact across social groups which highlight the need for policy attention and hard infrastructure design changes. Mitigation and wider benefit outcomes cannot be achieved by individual or household level actions alone. They require the involvement of multiple actors, interconnected actions in sequence as well as in parallel, and support of hard infrastructure. Our results show that in mobility services, policy makers supported by spatial planners and service delivery providers are the major actors. In industry, major actors are policy makers followed by spatial planners and innovators. For buildings, key actors include spatial planners followed by policy makers. Besides these, strategic information sharing to enhance user awareness and education plays an important role in shaping behaviour. Digitalization, information and communication, and interactive technologies will play a significant role in understanding and modifying people's choices; however, these would also require regulatory attention. © 2021 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, and despite the historic uniqueness and importance of the dataset, efforts to extract tangible information from this dataset have primarily focused on visual interpretation. More sophisticated approaches have been either hampered or unrealized, often justified by the primitive quality of this early satellite product. In the current study we attempt to showcase the usability of Corona imagery outside the context of visual interpretation. Using a 1968 Corona image acquired over the city municipality of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, we reconstruct a panchromatic 1.8 m spatial resolution georegistered image with a relative displacement Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.616 (for x dimension) and 1.886 (for y dimension) and employ segmentation and texture analysis to discern agricultural parcels and settlements’ footprints. Population statistics of this past era are retrieved from national census and related to settlements’ footprints. An exponential relationship between the two variables was identified by applying a semi-log regression. The high adjusted R2 value found (76.54%) indicates that Corona images offer a unique opportunity for population data analysis of the past. Overall, we showcase that the Corona images’ usability extends beyond the visual interpretation, and features of interest extracted through image analysis can be subsequently used for further geographical and historical research. © 2021 by the authors.

Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different regions of the globe, these analyses have been constrained due to the usage of station based data which is mostly limited up to the metropolitan cities. Also the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage of in-situ data. Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution satellites and merged products of air pollutants, we analyze the air quality across the globe and quantify the improvement resulting from the suppressed anthropogenic activity during the lockdowns. In particular, we focus on megacities, capitals and cities with high standards of living to make the quantitative assessment. Our results offer valuable insights into the spatial distribution of changes in the air pollutants due to COVID-19 enforced lockdowns.

It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment?

Unfortunately, this design does not pay significant attention to mobile services in underserved areas. In this context, the use of aerial radio access networks (ARANs) is a promising strategy to complement existing terrestrial communication systems. Involving airborne components such as unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, and satellites, ARANs can quickly establish a flexible access infrastructure on demand. ARANs are expected to support the development of seamless mobile communication systems toward a comprehensive sixth-generation (6G) global access infrastructure. This paper provides an overview of recent studies regarding ARANs in the literature. First, we investigate related work to identify areas for further exploration in terms of recent knowledge advancements and analyses. Second, we define the scope and methodology of this study. Then, we describe ARAN architecture and its fundamental features for the development of 6G networks. In particular, we analyze the system model from several perspectives, including transmission propagation, energy consumption, communication latency, and network mobility. Furthermore, we introduce technologies that enable the success of ARAN implementations in terms of energy replenishment, operational management, and data delivery. Subsequently, we discuss application scenarios envisioned for these technologies. Finally, we highlight ongoing research efforts and trends toward 6G ARANs. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",6G; access infrastructure; aerial radio access network; unmanned aerial vehicles,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101778497

We hypothesize that the capacity of individual farmers to plant on time varies considerably, shaped by multifaceted enabling factors and constraints that are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, two complementary datasets were used to characterize drivers and decision processes that govern the timing of rice planting in this region. The first dataset was a large agricultural management survey (rice-wheat: n = 15,245; of which rice: n = 7597) from a broad geographic region that was analyzed by machine learning methods. The second dataset was a discussion-based survey (n = 112) from a more limited geography that we analyzed with graph theory tools to elicit nuanced information on planting decisions. By combining insights from these methods, we show for the first time that differences in rice planting times are primarily shaped by ecosystem and climate factors while social factors play a prominent secondary role. Monsoon onset, surface and groundwater availability, and land type determine village-scale mean planting times whereas, for resource-constrained farmers who tend to plant later ceteris paribus, planting is further influenced by access to farm machinery, seed, fertilizer, and labor. Also, a critical threshold for economically efficient pumping appears at a groundwater depth of around 4.5 m; below this depth, farmers do not irrigate and delay planting. Without collective action to spread risk through synchronous timely planting, ecosystem factors such as threats posed by pests and wild animals may further deter early planting by individual farmers. Accordingly, we propose a three-pronged strategy that combines targeted strengthening of agricultural input chains, agroadvisory development, and coordinated rice planting and wildlife conservation to support climate-resilient agricultural development in the Eastern Gangetic Plains. © 2021, The Author(s).",Climate-resilient agroecosystems; Eastern Gangetic Plains; Groundwater; Landscape level; Machine learning; Mixed methods; Monsoon onset; Rice-wheat system; Sowing date; Sustainable agriculture,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101285161

If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention.

Recent studies have shown deep diagnostic models may not be robust in the inference process and may pose severe security concerns in clinical practice. Among all the factors that make the model not robust, the most serious one is adversarial examples. The so-called “adversarial example” is a well-designed perturbation that is not easily perceived by humans but results in a false output of deep diagnostic models with high confidence. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of deep diagnostic models by adversarial attack. Specifically, we have performed two types of adversarial attacks to three deep diagnostic models in both single-label and multi-label classification tasks, and found that these models are not reliable when attacked by adversarial example. We have further explored how adversarial examples attack the models, by analyzing their quantitative classification results, intermediate features, discriminability of features and correlation of estimated labels for both original/clean images and those adversarial ones. We have also designed two new defense methods to handle adversarial examples in deep diagnostic models, i.e., Multi-Perturbations Adversarial Training (MPAdvT) and Misclassification-Aware Adversarial Training (MAAdvT). The experimental results have shown that the use of defense methods can significantly improve the robustness of deep diagnostic models against adversarial attacks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Adversarial attack; Deep diagnostic models; Defense; Robustness,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100376413

Maps produced before the expansion of large-scale mechanized agriculture reflect a landscape that is lost today. Of particular interest to us is the great quantity of archaeologically relevant information that these maps recorded, both deliberately and incidentally. Despite the importance of the information they contain, researchers have only recently begun to automatically digitize and extract data from such maps as coherent information, rather than manually examine a raster image. However, these new approaches have focused on specific types of information that cannot be used directly for archaeological or heritage purposes. This paper provides a proof of concept of the application of deep learning techniques to extract archaeological information from historical maps in an automated manner. Early twentieth century colonial map series have been chosen, as they provide enough time depth to avoid many recent large-scale landscape modifications and cover very large areas (comprising several countries). The use of common symbology and conventions enhance the applicability of the method. The results show deep learning to be an efficient tool for the recovery of georeferenced, archaeologically relevant information that is represented as conventional signs, line-drawings and text in historical maps. The method can provide excellent results when an adequate training dataset has been gathered and is therefore at its best when applied to the large map series that can supply such information. The deep learning approaches described here open up the possibility to map sites and features across entire map series much more quickly and coherently than other available methods, opening up the potential to reconstruct archaeological landscapes at continental scales. © 2021 The Authors.

A series of protests commenced on 3 April 2019 against the Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement have severely impacted the HK tourism industry as the destination may deem to be unsafe by tourists to revisit. This study is important because HK protests happened at least 10 protests per month from April to December 2019, which have brought an adverse impact on the tourism industry. Using a survey method, we collected 176 data from those who had prior experience visiting HK, and data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Overall, the findings demonstrate that attitudes mediate the effect of tourists’ trust on revisit intention, but no direct effect of trust on revisit intention ascribe to hazard protests. Recognizing greater uncertainty arises following reports from media that prominently inform tourists’ decision-making, and how self-perceived trust influences attitudes on hazards offers intriguing managerial and practical implications for managers and policymakers.

Prior to being rice, the rice-grain (grain) is previously husked and/or milled by the milling machine. Relevantly, the grain quality depends on its pureness of particular grain specie (without the mixing between different grain species). For the demand of grain purity inspection by an image, many researchers have proposed the grain classification (sometimes with localization) methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN). However, those papers are necessary to have a large number of labeling that was too expensive to be manually collected. In this paper, the image augmentation (rotation, brightness adjustment and horizontal flipping) is appiled to generate more number of grain images from the less data. From the results, image augmentation improves the performance in CNN and bag-of-words model.

Opinions on how to address it are deeply divided across the conservation community. Approaches fall into two broad categories: making the trade illegal to protect against any form of commercial trade or allowing some or all of the trade to be legal and seeking to manage it through sustainable trade. The conservation community is often deeply polarized on which is the better option. We posit that a way to choose between these options is by considering species-specific attributes of biological productivity, management context, and demand. We develop a conceptual framework to assess which option is more likely to result in successful conservation of a species. We show how to construct a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to model how these attributes (1) interact to affect the sustainability of the species’ population and (2) vary under different trade management regimes. This approach can support scientifically based decision-making, by predicting the likely sustainability outcome for a population of a species under different trade management regimes, given its particular characteristics and context. The BBN allows identification of key points at which conservation interventions could change the potential outcome. It also provides the opportunity to explore how different assumptions about how humans might respond to different trade regimes affects outcomes. We illustrate these ideas by using the BBN for a hypothetical terrestrial mammal species population and discuss how the BBN can be extended for species with different characteristics, for example, those that can be stockpiled or when there are multiple products. This approach has the potential to help the conservation community to assess the most appropriate regime for managing wildlife trade in a transparent, open, and scientifically based way. © Copyright © 2021 Bennett, Underwood and Milner-Gulland.",Bayesian Belief Networks; commercial wildlife trade; decision support tools; resolving controversies; terrestrial mammals,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103014742

These inverters dominated HPS have no revolving body, therefore, diminishing the overall grid inertia. Such a low system inertia could create issues for HPS with REG (HPSREG) such as system instability and lack of resilience under disturbances. A control strategy, therefore, is required in order to manage this task besides benefitting from the full potential of the REGs. A virtual inertia control for an HPSREG system built with the principle of fractional order (FO) by incorporation of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been projected. It is utilized by adding virtual inertia into HPSREG system control loop and referred to as FO based fuzzy PID controller for this study.

It has been noted that the proposed control scheme exhibits improved efficiency in maintaining specific reference frequency and power tracking as well as disturbance diminution than optimal classic and FO-based controller. It has been validated that, the developed controller effectively delivers preferred frequency and power provision to a low-inertia HPSREG system against high load demand perturbation. In the presented paper, analysis based on sensitivity has also been performed and it has been found that the HPSREG system’s is not effected by system parameter and load variations. © 2021 by the authors.

The vulnerability of communities to flood-related hazards can be reduced by proper planning, preparedness, and responses using various structural and nonstructural measures. The community-based flood early warning system is one such tool that enables local communities to enhance their resilience to flooding risks. This paper highlights the efficacy of the community assessment of flood risks and early warning systems. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper evaluates the progress of a community-based flood early warning system implemented in the Ratu River—a small tributary of the Koshi River. The establishment of a community network in 2015 was instrumental in the dissemination of flood early warning information and in building local capacities to understand the risks and take timely action. The flood early warning resulted in awareness-raising, strengthened upstream–downstream linkages, and resulted in a greater willingness among communities to help each other prepare for flood disasters in the Ratu watershed. © 2021 by the authors.

Accordingly, restaurant diners who are concerned about food safety and unsure of whether it is truly safe to dine out, put more importance on the entire stages of service consumption. Restaurants must make their best efforts to minimize service failures in their service provision process and outcomes. Given that customers from different cultures are reported to evaluate service quality differently, this study was designed to investigate what actions Chinese customers who encounter service failures would take under the influence of Guanxi. Guanxi represents Chinese attitudes towards long-term individual and business relationships and ultimately involves moral obligations and mutual favors. Analyzing our structural equation model using 439 responses obtained from Chinese diners, this study determined that Chinese consumers would react differently in the service process failures and outcome failures in terms of negative word-of-mouth, direct complaints, switching intention, and revisit intention. More importantly, this study confirmed the significant moderating effects of Guanxi within the proposed relationships. Based on the study’s findings, useful implications are provided for academics and practitioners regarding sustained restaurant businesses. © 2021 by the authors.

Pakistan is moving in the right direction, placing focus on renewable energy resources in its current infrastructure in order to address the energy shortage. Several projects (e.g., wind power and solar PV (photovoltaic) technologies) are operational or under development; they are intended to reduce energy challenges in Pakistan. The new government in Pakistan aims to increase the share of renewable energy in total power generation to 30% by 2030. On the other hand, Turkey surpasses Pakistan in renewable energy resources; for example, there are 186 operational wind energy power plants across the country. In addition, Turkey utilizes solar energy—mainly for residential usage. Turkey’s Vision 2023 energy agenda aims to supply 30% of their power demands from modern renewable energy resources. Turkey has implemented solar PV, solar buildings, wind power plants, geothermal energy resources, and biomass technology for heating, cooling and electricity generation. At present, Turkey’s supply to meet energy demands in the country is 56% fossil fuel energy resources and 44% renewable energy, including hydropower. Accessible details reveal that geothermal energy resources have been continuously neglected in Pakistan by the Ministry of Energy (power division); this is in contrast to the Turkish case, in which utilization of geothermal energy resources for heating and cooling purposes is efficient. With all the facts and figures under consideration, in this paper, comparative analyses are performed which reveal that the production of electricity from geothermal energy technologies is lower than the massive potential in both countries. Recommendations are made for important policies to promote renewable energy technologies, which could effectively support energy decentralization by providing electricity to rural areas and the national grid. © 2021 by the authors.

The multi-linear regression (MLR) approach is used with six different socio-demographic and economic parameters, i.e., urban population, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, urban literacy rate, urban poverty incidence, urban household size and urban unemployment rate. Different reliable models are generated under four different scenarios. The value of R2 (a relative measure of fit) and value of performance indicators (an absolute measure of fit) such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are calculated to assure the validity and accuracy of the results. Model 2 of Scenario 4 is estimated as the best model, where population and GDP per capita show statistical significance for estimating urban solid waste generation rate in Laos. The amount of municipal solid waste is estimated to be 0.98 million tons (MT) in the year 2030, 1.26 MT in the year 2040 and 1.52 MT in the year 2050, assuming that the present waste generation trends will be followed in the future. Moreover, the study provides an easy and detailed explanation of the work which will increase the interest of researchers, allow them to understand the MLR approach clearly and inspire them to use it for other developing countries where the scarcity of data is a major obstacle in the field of solid waste management.

Nevertheless, the reliability of rainfall forecasts gradually declines for heavy rain events with lead time due to the lack of predictability. Recently, data-driven approaches were commonly implemented in hydrological problems. In this research, the data-driven models were developed based on the data obtained from a radar forecasting system named McGill Algorithm for Precipitation nowcasting by Lagrangian Extrapolation (MAPLE) and ground rain gauges. The data included thirteen urban stations in the five metropolitan cities located in South Korea. The twenty-five data points of MAPLE surrounding each rain station were utilized as the model input, and the observed rainfall at the corresponding gauges were used as the model output. The results showed superior capabilities of long short-term memory (LSTM) network in improving 180-minute rainfall forecasts at the stations based on a comparison of five different data-driven models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), basic recurrent neural network (RNN), and LSTM. Although the model still produced an underestimation of extreme rainfall values at some examined stations, this study proved that the LSTM could provide reliable performance.

Some healthcare facilities use standardized tools such as the Morse Fall Scale, but many use non-standardized tools created based on patient needs. Our study question was, why are non-standardized tools used when standardized tools are more beneficial and can be statistically evaluated and compared to other results; (2) Methods: We used a quantitative, non-standardized questionnaire to survey 1200 nurses, which was representative sample for the entire Czech Republic. All questionnaires were assessed in two phases (a) the frequency evaluation and descriptive analysis, and (b) hypotheses testing and correlation analyses; (3) Results: We found that the Conley Scale, Barthel test, and IADL test were preferred by many nurses. Furthermore, we found that nurses using standardized assessment scales noticed risk factors significantly more frequently but regarded the increased complexity of care to be psychologically demanding.

Finally, we proposed a process wherein the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model was applied to identify features for efficiently detecting anomalous behavior in smart cities. Experimental results using random forest show that our extracted features based on a game bot can achieve an average F1-score of 0.99903 using 10-fold validation.

To justify CWF with scientific evidence inevitably leads to ethical justification, which raises the question of whether oral health is of individual concern or social responsibility. As dental caries is a public health problem, public health ethics should be applied to the topic instead of generic clinical ethics. From both proand anti-fluoridationists’ perspectives, CWF is a public health policy requiring a significant level of intervention. Thus, there needs to take further considerations for justifying CWF beyond the simple aspect of utility. For further ethical considerations on CWF, three caveats were suggested: procedural justice, social contexts, and maintenance of trust. The process to justify CWF should also be justified, not simply by majority rule but participatory decision-making with transparency and pluralistic democracy. Social contexts are to be part of the process of resolving conflicting values in public health interventions. Public trust in the dental profession and the oral healthcare system should be maintained over the considerations.

The Malaysian government has taken a serious initiative in spurring the use of m-wallets by providing a one-off RM30 incentive to all eligible Malaysians. As such, it is important to understand the motivations behind m-wallet usage by examining Alipay, which is favoured in the international, as well as Malaysian markets. This research investigates the effects of mobile payment knowledge, personal innovativeness, self-efficacy, convenience, and compatibility on the actual adoption of Alipay in Malaysia with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, as the mediators. Using importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) and Variance Accounted For (VAF), based on Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) on 260 respondents, it was discovered that compatibility and perceived usefulness demonstrated high importance in improving the performance of Alipay adoption. The results also showed a direct effect between compatibility and mobile payment knowledge. Additionally, perceived usefulness was shown to be an essential mediator in influencing the impact of compatibility and convenience on the actual adoption of Alipay.

Knowledge regarding the motivations and spatial behavior of tourists has great potential in sustainable tourism studies. In this paper, we combine social media (Twitter) and mobile positioning data (MPD) in the analysis of international tourism flows in Szeged, a secondary urban center in Hungary. First, the content of geotagged and non-geotagged Twitter messages referring to Szeged in a six-month period of 2018 was analyzed. In this way specific events attracting foreign tourists were identified. Then, using MPD data of foreign SIM cards, visitor peaks in the investigated period were defined. With the joint application of the social media and mobile positioning analytical tools, we were able to identify those attractions (festivals, sport and cultural events, etc.) that generated significant tourism arrivals in the city. Furthermore, using the mixed-method approach we were also able to analyze the movements of foreign visitors during one large-scale tourism event and evaluate its hinterland. Overall, this study supports the idea that social media data should be combined with other real-time data sources, such as MPD, in order to gain a more precise understanding of the behavior of tourists. The proposed analytical tool can contribute to methodological and conceptual development in the field, and information gained by its application can positively influence not only tourism management and planning but also tourism marketing and placemaking. © 2021 by the authors.

These technologies are mainly sunlight?based photovoltaic (PV), wind power, and tidal resources, which vigorously rely upon ecological conditions. For a reliable and livable energy supply to the electricity grid from renewable means, electrical energy storage technologies can play an important role while considering the weather effects in order to provide immaculate, safe, and continuous energy throughout the generation period. Energy storage technologies (ESTs) charge themselves during the low power demand period and discharge when the demand of electricity increases in such a way that they act as a catalyst to provide energy boost to the power grid. In this paper, we presented and discussed the renewable ESTs for each type with respect to their operational mechanism. In this regard, the renewable energy scenarios of Pakistan and Turkey are first discussed in detail by analyzing the actual potential of each renewable energy resource in both the countries.

E?waste requires proper management procedures, which involve the design of a reverse logistics management network. Consumers play a critical role in such a network, because the network runs when they willingly participate as suppliers of waste. This paper applies the Theory of Planned Behavior framework and extends it using Reverse Logistics drivers, the Value Belief Norm Theory, and facility accessibility to explain consumer intention to participate in e?waste collection programs. A survey was conducted on smartphone users in Indo-nesia, with a total of 324 valid questionnaires. The results showed that government drivers, facility accessibility, and personal attitudes significantly influence consumer intentions. Environmental concern has a positive influence on consumer intentions through the variables of the Theory of Planned Behavior and perceived behavioral control through government drivers. This study shows the need for integration, because the variables reinforce each other. However, neither economic drivers nor subjective norms significantly influence consumer intentions. This finding distinguishes Indonesia from other countries, especially developed countries, in that e?waste collection programs have not become part of the culture in Indonesia. For this reason, Indonesia needs regulations, as the most influential variable, to regulate the implementation of such a program. © 2021 by the authors.

Social networks have experienced enormous growth as online personal networking media. Social exchange theory (for motivation and social reward) and theories of collective action can be applied in order to understand how an individual’s behavior may exert effects on or receive influences from other users with regard to the continuance usage intention of social apps. First, this study aims to examine be-havioral characteristics of the Millennials, and takes flow and social reward systematically so as to explore SNS users’ continuance based on SNS characteristics. Targeting Millennials SNS users, this study empirically examines users’ continuance intention at individual level and simulates users’ continuance behavior at group level, which are expected to be influential as a next generation of purchasing group, focusing on social network services (SNS) usage. Second, this study tries to suggest strategic implications by identifying key factors that dominate SNS users’ behavior in the process of experiencing SNS. For the empirical purpose, this study analyzes the relationship between SNS characteristics (motivation to use, density, and centrality) and usage behavior (flow, social re-ward, and continuous intention to use). As a result, each construct of motivation to use SNS, SNS density, and SNS centrality are positively linked with flow. Motivation to use SNS and SNS centrality are positively associated with social reward, however, SNS density does not have a significant effect on social reward. In addition, flow and social reward turn out to have positive linkage with continuous intention to use respectively. The findings of this study are expected to provide implications for researchers and operators in related fields to identify various factors that explain the SNS usages of the Millennials, especially the major factors that sustain SNS involvement and activities. This study can enrich both SNS continuance theory, and help SNS operators to manipulate re-sources effectively to attract and retain users. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as one of the closest attachments of urban dwellers, urban furniture hardly contributes to pandemic prevention and control. Meth-ods: Given this critical challenge, this article aims to propose a feasible solution to coping with pandemic situations through urban furniture design, using an integrated method of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). Eight communities in China are selected as the research sites, since people working and living in these places have successful experience preventing and containing pandemics. Results: Three user requirements (URs), namely, usability and easy access, sanitation, and health and emotional pleasure, are determined. Meanwhile, seven design requirements (DRs) are identified, including contact reduction, effective disinfection, good appearance, social and cultural symbols, ergonomics, smart system and technology and sustaina-bility. The overall priorities of URs and DRs and their inner dependencies are subsequently determined through the ANP-QFD method, comprising the House of Quality (HQQ). According to the theoretical results, we propose five design strategies for pandemic prevention and control. Conclu-sion: It is demonstrated that the incorporated method of ANP-QFD has applicability and effectiveness in the conceptual product design process.

The members of this almost exclusively Old-World genus grow mostly on highly porous substrates across open steppe, semidesert, or ruderal habitats in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere and African subtropics. The present study placed the biological history of Sisymbrium L. into time and space and rendered the tribus Sisymbrieae as monotypic. Five nuclear-encoded and three chloroplast-encoded loci of approximately 85% of all currently accepted species were investigated. Several accessions per species covering their whole distribution range allowed for a more representative assessment of intraspecific genetic diversity. In the light of fossil absence, the impact of different secondary calibration methods and taxon sets on time spans was tested, and we showed that such a combinatorial nested dating approach is beneficial. Multigene phylogeny accompanied with a time divergence estimation analysis placed the onset and development of this tribus into the western Irano-Turanian floristic region during the Miocene. Continuous increase in continentality and decrease in temperatures promoted the diversity of the Sisymbrieae, which invaded the open grasslands habitats in Eurasia, Mediterranean, and South Africa throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene.

Fintech enables institutions to deliver services to customers worldwide on a 24/7 basis. Its services are often easy to access and enable customers to perform transactions in real-time. In fact, advantages such as these make Fintech increasingly popular among clients. However, since Fintech transactions are made up of information, ensuring security becomes a critical issue. Vulnerabilities in such systems leave them exposed to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to clients and providers alike. For this reason, techniques from the area of Machine Learning (ML) are applied to identify anomalies in Fintech applications. They target suspicious activity in financial datasets and generate models in order to anticipate future frauds. We contribute to this important issue and provide an evaluation on anomaly detection methods for this matter. Experiments were conducted on several fraudulent datasets from real-world and synthetic databases, respectively. The obtained results confirm that ML methods contribute to fraud detection with varying success. Therefore, we discuss the effectiveness of the individual methods with regard to the detection rate. In addition, we provide an analysis on the influence of selected features on their performance. Finally, we discuss the impact of the observed results for the security of Fintech applications in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the ECG signal of a person may vary according to factors such as the emotional or physical state, thus hindering authentication. We propose an adaptive ECG-based authentication method that performs incremental learning to identify ECG signals from a subject under a variety of measurement conditions. An incremental support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for authentication implementing incremental learning. We collected ECG signals from 11 subjects during 10 min over six days and used the data from days 1 to 5 for incremental learning, and those from day 6 for testing. The authentication results show that the proposed system consistently reduces the false acceptance rate from 6.49% to 4.39% and increases the true acceptance rate from 61.32% to 87.61% per single ECG wave after incremental learning using data from the five days. In addition, the authentication results tested using data obtained a day after the latest training show the false acceptance rate being within reliable range (3.5–5.33%) and improvement of the true acceptance rate (70.05–87.61%) over five days. © 2021 by the authors.

The primary cause of death due to COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARS-CoV-2. Medical imaging provides a non-invasive, touch-free, and relatively safer alternative tool for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",ARDS; Artificial intelligence; Comorbidity; COVID-19; CT; Deep learning; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Transfer learning; Ultrasound; US; X-ray,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100435359

Future drought outlook is of vital importance for policy-making to combat drought risk and water crises over the long term. Here, 3- and 12-month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices, which can aid short- and long-term drought monitoring, respectively, are coupled with the SOM-Kmeans two-stage clustering technique to map the future drought conditions in China for the future period (2021–2050) relative to the baseline period (1976–2005). The calculation is based on downscaled outputs of 10 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The temperature increases by 0.5–2.0 °C and 1.0–2.5 °C under the selected RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The results show that the differences between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are projected to increase throughout China. Most parts of China are projected to experience more severe, more frequent and longer duration droughts in the next three decades compared with the baseline period. Global warming is projected to have a serious impact on future droughts in the basins located in the northern part of China. The drought conditions in the northwest region of the “Hu Huanyong Line” in China are projected to be serious and complex in the future, while the opposite is true in the southeastern region. Drought conditions in northern China are more complex under high temperature changes (1.0–2.5 °C) than under low changes (0.5–2.0 °C). The results of this study provide insights on future drought planning and management in China and demonstrate that SOM-Kmeans can be used for the classification of drought conditions. © 2021 The Author(s)",CMIP5 models; Drought projection; Hu huanyong line; SOM-Kmeans; SPEI,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100155110

Hence, this study aimed to develop a predictive model for soil temperature and evaluate the potential distribution of a few ant species in South Korea. The monthly maximum and minimum soil temperatures were predicted by linear regression as a function of the monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures. Then, the developed model was used to predict the potential distribution of the tropical fire ant (Solenopsis geminata Fabricius; TFA), red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren; RIFA), and yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes Smith; YCA). Three ant species were selected because they have globally exerted negative impacts on the ecology of the invading area. The developed model could predict soil temperatures at 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm deep with an R2 value of 0.95. The climate suitability of TFA, RIFA, and YCA, predicted by soil temperature in the CLIMEX model, was found to be up to 25, 12, and 65 times higher than the climate suitability predicted by air temperature, respectively. This study showed that the potential distribution predicted based on air and soil temperature could be different for a species inhabiting the ground, suggesting that it is necessary to consider not only the outside environment, but also the soil environment, for an accurate prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",CLIMEX; Red imported fire ant; Soil temperature model; Tropical fire ant; Yellow crazy ant,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099933877

To harness the full potential of smart city initiatives, it is vital for policymakers to align citizens with the project objectives. This study comprehensively characterizes and classifies top-down announcements formulated by city developers into six alignment categories (i.e., smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living) using natural language processing. The proposed framework consists of five main processes: (1) web scraping-based extraction of announcements of four smart cities – Boston, Helsinki, Seoul, and Taipei, (2) text data preprocessing, (3) latent Dirichlet allocation-based modeling of strategic topics, (4) quantification of inter-topic similarities using Hellinger distance, and (5) comparison of top-down communication trends with real-world levels of urban performance. Through the comparative analysis of top-down communication trends and actual urban performances, the top-down discourses of smart cities were deconstructed as a reflection of wider political programs developed to enhance citizen alignment and urban performances. Furthermore, inter-topic similarities were also quantified to reflect whether communication strategies are multidisciplinary and city-tailored.

Thus, the paper elaborates upon an alternative mode of person-environment-interaction based approach towards placemaking: Empathic Cities. This approach implies embracing a shift from efficiency to sufficiency and wellbeing embedded regenerative perspective for conceiving the built environment. First, the variable dimensions of urban growth and governance, which gave rise to the smart city, are contextualized. The embedded neoliberal operational agenda of smart cities are established. On this basis, the underpinnings of an empathic city are established by acknowledging the shift from techno-centric to human-centric and from product-based to context-based smart city and wellbeing perspectives. Strategies toward urban development are proposed, such as embracing a regenerative perspective wherein the city and its constituents need to be understood as interdependent systemic elements while embracing a human-centric and ethical approach. Additionally, a transition from efficiency to sufficiency-oriented practices and a shift towards inclusive modes of participatory governance are proposed as fundamental principles for an empathic future of the built environment. © 2020 The Author",Empathic city; Neoliberalism; Regenerative model; Smart city; Wellbeing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094627380

They have been largely investigated thanks to their high retention capacity, which can be a valid support to mitigate the pluvial flood risk and to increase the building thermal insulation, ensuring energy saving. Moreover, green roofs contribute to restoring vegetation in the urban environment, increasing the biodiversity and adding aesthetic value to the city. The new generation of multilayer green roofs present an additional layer with respect to traditional ones, which allows rainwater to be stored, which, if properly treated, can be reused for different purposes. This paper offers a review of benefits and limitations of green roofs, with a focus on multilayer ones, within a Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem nexus context. This approach enables the potential impact of green roofs on the different sectors to be highlighted, investigating also the interactions and interconnections among the fields.

However, the studies about agricultural drought risk mapping are very limited in Australia. Therefore, a comprehensive agricultural drought risk assessment approach that incorporates all the risk components with their influencing criteria is essential to generate detailed drought risk information for operational drought management. A comprehensive agricultural drought risk assessment approach was prepared in this work incorporating all components of risk (hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and mitigation capacity) with their relevant criteria using geospatial techniques. The prepared approach is then applied to identify the spatial pattern of agricultural drought risk for Northern New South Wales region of Australia. A total of 16 relevant criteria under each risk component were considered, and fuzzy logic aided geospatial techniques were used to prepare vulnerability, exposure, hazard, and mitigation capacity indices. These indices were then incorporated to quantify agricultural drought risk comprehensively in the study area. The outputs depicted that about 19.2% and 41.7% areas are under very-high and moderate to high risk to agricultural droughts, respectively. The efficiency of the results is successfully evaluated using a drought inventory map.

Optical satellite remote sensing has proven to be an effective tool for monitoring global and regional variations in snow cover. However, accurately capturing the characteristics of snow dynamics at a finer spatiotemporal resolution continues to be problematic as observations from optical satellite sensors are greatly impacted by clouds and solar illumination. Traditional methods of mapping snow cover from passive microwave data only provide binary information at a spatial resolution of 25 km. This innovative study applies the random forest regression technique to enhanced-resolution passive microwave brightness temperature data (6.25 km) to estimate fractional snow cover over North America in winter months (January and February). Many influential factors, including land cover, topography, and location information, were incorporated into the retrieval models. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products between 2008 and 2017 were used to create the reference fractional snow cover data as the ""true""observations in this study. Although overestimating and underestimating around two extreme values of fractional snow cover, the proposed retrieval algorithm outperformed the other three approaches (linear regression, artificial neural networks, and multivariate adaptive regression splines) using independent test data for all land cover classes with higher accuracy and no out-of-range estimated values. The method enabled the evaluation of the estimated fractional snow cover using independent datasets, in which the root mean square error of evaluation results ranged from 0.189 to 0.221. The snow cover detection capability of the proposed algorithm was validated using meteorological station observations with more than 310 000 records. We found that binary snow cover obtained from the estimated fractional snow cover was in good agreement with ground measurements (kappa: 0.67). There was significant improvement in the accuracy of snow cover identification using our algorithm; the overall accuracy increased by 18 % (from 0.71 to 0.84), and the omission error was reduced by 71 % (from 0.48 to 0.14) when the threshold of fractional snow cover was 0.3. The experimental results show that passive microwave brightness temperature data may potentially be used to estimate fractional snow cover directly in that this retrieval strategy offers a competitive advantage in snow cover detection. © Author(s) 2021.

These techniques were driven by twelve different models generated from input combinations of satellite data and hydrometeorological parameters. The results indicated that the eighth model performed best and was superior among all the models, with the SVM algorithm resulting in an R2 value of 0.82 and the lowest errors in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.33) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.20), followed by the Matern 5/2 Gaussian model with an R2 value of 0.75 and RMSE and MAE of 0.39 and 0.21 mm/day, respectively. Moreover, among all the five methods, the SVM and Matern 5/2 Gaussian methods were the best-performing ML algorithms in our study of CTEI predictions for the Ganga basin. © 2021 by the authors.

In previous research, we achieved three different households’ clusters. The first one grouped households with high knowledge of the integral water cycle and a positive attitude to smart devices at home. The second cluster described households with low knowledge of the integral water cycle and high sensitivity to price. The third one showed average knowledge and predisposition to have a closer relationship with the water company. This paper continues with this research line, applying Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to determine which hierarchy of variables/factors/independent components obtained from the surveys are the decisive ones to predict the range of household water consumption in Huelva. Positive attitudes towards improved cleaning habits for personal or house- hold purposes are the highest hierarchy component to predict the water consumption range. Second in the hierarchy, the variable Knowledge Global Score about the integral urban water cycle, associated with water literacy, also contributes to predicting the water consumption range. Together with the three clusters obtained previously, these results will allow us to design water demand management strategies (WDM) fit for purpose that enable Huelva’s households to use water more efficiently. © 2021 by the authors.

A failure of such large equipment can be a serious problem in terms of safety or costs. This paper proposes a prediction model that can proactively prevent failures that may occur in a hypergravity accelerator.

A 4-channel accelerometer was attached to the bearing housing, which is a rotor, and time-amplitude data were obtained from the measured values by sampling. The method proposed in this paper was trained with transfer learning, a deep learning model that replaced the VGG19 model with a Fully Connected Layer (FCL) and Global Average Pooling (GAP) by converting the vibration signal into a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) spectrogram and converting the input into a 2D image.

We highlight multiple cases to illustrate the risks posed by existing gaps in understanding the intersectionality of the illegal wildlife trade and zoonotic disease transmission. We argue for more integrative science in support of decision-making using the One Health approach. Opportunities abound to apply transdisciplinary science to sustainable wildlife trade policy and programming, such as combining on-the-ground monitoring of health, environmental, and social conditions with an understanding of the operational and spatial dynamics of illicit wildlife trade. We advocate for (1) a surveillance sample management system for enhanced diagnostic efficiency in collaboration with diverse and local partners that can help establish new or link existing surveillance networks, outbreak analysis, and risk mitigation strategies; (2) novel analytical tools and decision support models that can enhance self-directed local livelihoods by addressing monitoring, detection, prevention, interdiction, and remediation; (3) enhanced capacity to promote joint SB&S efforts that can encourage improved human and animal health, timely reporting, emerging disease detection, and outbreak response; and, (4) enhanced monitoring of illicit wildlife trade and supply chains across the heterogeneous context within which they occur.

The traditional approaches that are used to reconstruct missing weather radar images replace missing frames with the nearest image or with interpolated images. However, the performance of these approaches is defective, and their accuracy is quite limited due to neglecting the intensification and disappearance of radar echoes. In this study, we propose a deep neuron network (DNN), which combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bi-directional convolutional long short-term memory networks (CNN-BiConvLSTMs), to address this problem and establish a deep-learning benchmark. The model is trained to be capable of dealing with arbitrary missing patterns by using the proposed training schedule. Then the performances of the model are evaluated and compared with baseline models for different missing patterns. These baseline models include the nearest neighbor approach, linear interpolation, optical flow methods, and two DNN models three-dimensional CNN (3DCNN) and CNN-ConvLSTM. Experimental results show that the CNN-BiConvLSTM model outperforms all other baseline models. The influence of data quality on interpolation methods is further investigated, and the CNN-BiConvLSTM model is found to be basically uninfluenced by less qualified input weather radar images, which reflects the robustness of the model. Our results suggest good prospects for applying the CNN-BiConvLSTM model to improve the quality of weather radar datasets. © 2021 by the authors.

Many models have been proposed in the literature to estimate rain attenuation. Various models have a distinct set of input parameters along with separate estimation mechanisms. This survey has garnered multiple techniques that can generate input dataset for the rain attenuation models. This study extensively investigates the existing terrestrial rain attenuation models. There is no survey of terrestrial rain mitigation models to the best of our knowledge.

Machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) have been rarely applied to multispectral remote sensing data for differentiating between limestone formations formed due to different depositional environments, such as oolitic or fossiliferous. Unlike the previous studies that mostly report lithological classification of rock types having different chemical compositions by the MLAs, this paper aimed to investigate MLAs’ potential for mapping subclasses within the same lithology, i.e., limestone. Additionally, selecting appropriate data labels, training algorithms, hyperparameters, and remote sensing data sources were also investigated while applying these MLAs. In this paper, first, oolitic (Samanasuk), fossiliferous (Lockhart and Margalla) limestone-bearing formations along with the adjoining Hazara formation were mapped using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and naïve Bayes (NB) MLAs. The RF algorithm reported the best accuracy of 83.28% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.78. To further improve the targeted allochemical limestone formation map, annotation labels were generated by the fusion of maps obtained from principal component analysis (PCA), decorrelation stretching (DS), X-means clustering applied to ASTER-L1T, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 datasets. These labels were used to train and validate SVM, CART, NB, and RF MLAs to obtain a binary classification map of limestone occurrences in the Hazara division, Pakistan using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The classification of Landsat-8 data by CART reported 99.63% accuracy, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.99, and was in good agreement with the field validation. This binary limestone map was further classified into oolitic (Samanasuk) and fossiliferous (Lockhart and Margalla) formations by all the four MLAs; in this case, RF surpassed all the other algorithms with an improved accuracy of 96.36%. This improvement can be attributed to better annotation, resulting in a binary limestone classification map, which formed a mask for improved classification of oolitic and fossiliferous limestone in the area. © 2021 by the authors.",Geological mapping; Google earth engine; Image fusion; Machine learning; Multispectral remote sensing; Remote sensing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106469339

Genetic algorithm optimization has progressed complex planning, but challenges remain in developing practical alternatives to random initialization, genetic mutations, and to pragmatically balance competing objectives. To meet these practical needs, we developed a Land use Intensity-restricted Multi-objective Spatial Optimization (LIr-MSO) model with more realistic patch size initialization, novel mutation, elite strategies, and objectives balanced via nominalizations and weightings. We tested the model for Dapeng, China where experiments compared comprehensive fitness (across conversion cost, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), ecosystem services value, compactness, and conflict degree) with three contrast experiments, in which changes were separately made in the initialization and mutation. The comprehensive model gave superior fitness compared to the contrast experiments. Iterations progressed rapidly to near-optimality, but final convergence involved much slower parent-offspring mutations. Tradeoffs between conversion cost and compactness were strongest, and conflict degree improved in part as an emergent property of the spatial social connectedness built into our algorithm. Observations of rapid iteration to near-optimality with our model can facilitate interactive simulations, not possible with current models, involving land-use planners and regional managers. © 2021 by the authors.",Genetic algorithm; Land-use optimization; Spatial compactness,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106465278

The importance of infrastructure as a major pillar of support in cities, in addition to the rapid developments in smart city research, necessitate an up?to?date review of smart cities’ infrastructure issues and challenges. Traditionally, a majority of studies have focused on traffic control and management, transport network design, smart grid initiatives, IoT (Internet of Things) integration, big data, land use development, and how urbanization processes impact land use in the long run. The work presented herein proposes a novel review framework that analyzes how smart city infrastructure is related to the urbanization process while presenting developments in IoT sensor networks, big data analysis of the generated information, and green construction. A classification framework was proposed to give insights on new initiatives regarding smart city infrastructure through answering the following questions: (i) What are the various dimensions on which smart city infrastructure research focuses? (ii) What are the themes and classes associated with these dimensions? (iii) What are the main shortcomings in current approaches, and what would be a good research agenda for the future? A bibliometric analysis was conducted, presenting cluster maps that can be used to understand different research trends and refine further searches. A bibliographic analysis was then followed, presenting a review of the most relevant studies over the last five years. The method proposed serves to stress where future research into understanding smart systems, their implementation and functionality would be best directed.

One concern for these devices, which is constantly becoming more critical, is their protection against attacks due to their heterogeneity and the absence of international standards to achieve this goal. Thus, these devices are becoming vulnerable, with many of them not even showing any signs of malfunction or suspicious behavior. The aim of the present work is to introduce a circuit that is connected in series with the power supply of a smart device, specifically an IP camera, which allows analysis of its behavior. The detection circuit operates in real time (real-time detection), sampling the supply current of the device, processing the sampled values and finally indicating any detection of abnormal activities, based on a comparison to normal operation conditions. By utilizing techniques borrowed by simple power analysis side channel attack, it was possible to detect deviations from the expected operation of the IP camera, as they occurred due to intentional attacks, quarantining the monitored device from the rest of the network. The circuit is analyzed and a low-cost implementation (under 5US$) is illustrated. It achieved 100% success in the test results, showing excellent performance in intrusion detection. © 2020 by the authors.

To achieve a higher detection rate, the ability to design an improved detection framework is sought after, particularly when utilizing ensemble learners. Designing an ensemble often lies in two main challenges such as the choice of available base classifiers and combiner methods. This paper performs an overview of how ensemble learners are exploited in IDSs by means of systematic mapping study. We collected and analyzed 124 prominent publications from the existing literature. The selected publications were then mapped into several categories such as years of publications, publication venues, datasets used, ensemble methods, and IDS techniques. Furthermore, this study reports and analyzes an empirical investigation of a new classifier ensemble approach, called stack of ensemble (SoE) for anomaly-based IDS. The SoE is an ensemble classifier that adopts parallel architecture to combine three individual ensemble learners such as random forest, gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting machine in a homogeneous manner. The performance significance among classification algorithms is statistically examined in terms of their Matthews correlation coefficients, accuracies, false positive rates, and area under ROC curve metrics. Our study fills the gap in current literature concerning an up-to-date systematic mapping study, not to mention an extensive empirical evaluation of the recent advances of ensemble learning techniques applied to IDSs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Anomaly detection; Combination methods; Empirical review; Ensemble learners; Intrusion detection systems; Stacking; Systematic mapping study; Tree-based classifier ensemble,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101089557

This paper reports a systematic review analysis on occupant behavior and different modeling approaches using the Scopus and Science Direct databases. The comprehensive review study focuses on the current understanding of occupant behavior, existing behavior modeling approaches and their limitations, and key influential parameters on building energy conservation. Finally, the study identifies six significant research gaps for future development: Occupant-centered space layout deployment; occupant behavior must be understood in the context of developing or low-income economies; there are higher numbers of quantitative occupant behavior studies than qualitative; the extensive use of survey or secondary data and the lack of real data used in model validation; behavior studies are required for diverse categories building; building information modeling (BIM) integration with existing occupant behavior modeling/simulation.

The bibliographic data, including abstracts, were collected from the Scopus database. In order to conduct the analysis, we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract the latent topics from the large quantity of research abstracts without any manual adjustment. The 10 main topics identified from our analysis revealed topographical maps of research in the field. By measuring the variation of topic distributions over time, we identified hot topics (research trends that are becoming increasingly popular over time) and cold topics. Sustainable consumer behavior, Sustainable community and Sustainable tourism were identified as being hot topics, while Education for sustainability was identified as the only cold topic.

In this sense, an important strategy is the promotion of green packaging, that is, the use of sustainable materials and designs for the packaging of goods. In recent years, many research works have been published in the specialised area covering the different perspectives and dimensions of green packaging. However, to our knowledge, no previous investigations have analysed the research activity on green packaging from business and consumer perspectives. The present study intends to fill this gap by analysing all of the publications found in the Scopus database with the help of visual analytic tools, including word clouds and Gephi network visualization software. More specifically, our study analyses the impact of green packaging from business and consumer viewpoints, including some specific issues such as the design and materials used in green packaging, green packaging costs, marketing strategies and corporate social responsibility related to green packaging, and the impact of green packaging in waste management, the circular economy, logistics, and supply chain management. The results obtained reveal the growing interest of scholars and researchers in all of these dimensions, as is made patently clear by the increasing number of journal publications in recent years. The practical implications of this study are significant, given the growing awareness among companies and consumers about the importance of the promotion of sustainable development through green packaging alternatives. More specifically, the results of this research could be very useful for all of those agents who are interested in learning about the main lines of research being developed in the field of green packaging. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to the complex nature of food insecurity, traditional linear methods of empirical analysis may mask critical relationships between food insecurity and demographic, agricultural, and environmental factors. Here we show, using two years of household-level survey data from Ethiopia and Nigeria, that nonparametric regression (“random forest”, in this study) enables enhanced insight into the factors associated with self-reported food security and household dietary diversity score. We observe nonlinearities and thresholds in the relationships between the measures of food security, livestock ownership, and climatic conditions. The threshold-based relationships suggest that policies aimed at increasing agricultural productivity (e.g., livestock holdings) may only be beneficial up to an extent. While it is intuitive that some level of diminishing returns will exist, our nonparametric analysis could be used as a first step to discern the levels to which policies may be beneficial. Additionally, our results indicate that the random forest (and perhaps nonparametric regression and classification methods more generally) may be especially well-positioned to uncover nuances in these relationships in years with suboptimal climatic conditions (such as during the 2015 drought in Ethiopia). Ultimately, we argue that nonparametric approaches, when informed by existing theory, provide an insightful complement to inform the analysis of agricultural and development policy. © 2021, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.",Agriculture; Food security; Nonparametric regression; Statistical inference,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100209064

However, we argue that the dilemmas of peri-metropolitan rural areas, such as Desakota in China, are far more complex faced with rural super village and hollowed village trans-formations. Rural revival planning needs to coordinate with the development of urbanized and rural areas towards multifunctional goals and plans as a whole. Therefore, we selected the town master plan of Lijia, a typical peri-metropolitan village in China, as a case study. Through a historical– interpretative approach involving analysis of planning policies, questionnaires, and in-depth inter-views with the key stakeholders involved, we structured the process and mechanism of rural revival in Lijia into three phases: resource identification, capitalization, and financialization. In different phases, different stakeholders adopt different roles. The government takes a leading role in resource identification and capitalization, while firms take a leading role in the process of financialization. “Market-dominant and government-guided” planning stimulates villagers to participate in rural revival. We highlight the importance of multifunctional land-use in terms of rural revival in the master planning of peri-metropolitan villages and provide a practical reference for uniting multiple stakeholders, including governments, firms, and villagers. © 2021 by the authors.

To date, there are several land suitability analysis (LSA) methods, but there is no consensus on the best method for crop suitability analysis. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate methodological strategies for LSA. Secondary to this, we assessed which of these would be suitable for neglected and underutilised crop species (NUS). The review classified LSA methods reported in articles as traditional (26.6%) and modern (63.4%). Modern approaches, including multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods such as analytical hierarchy process (AHP) (14.9%) and fuzzy methods (12.9%); crop simulation models (9.9%) and machine learning related methods (25.7%) are gaining popularity over traditional methods. The MCDM methods, namely AHP and fuzzy, are commonly applied to LSA while crop models and machine learning related methods are gaining popularity. A total of 67 parameters from climatic, hydrology, soil, socio-economic and landscape properties are essential in LSA. Unavailability and the inclusion of categorical datasets from social sources is a challenge. Using big data and Internet of Things (IoT) improves the accuracy and reliability of LSA methods. The review expects to provide researchers and decision-makers with the most robust methods and standard parameters required in developing LSA for NUS. Qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into unique hybrid land evaluation systems to improve LSA. © 2021 by the authors.

Various factors, including elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, flow accumulation, flow direction, topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, rainfall, and normalized difference vegetation index, were generated using a digital elevation model and LANDSAT 8 imagery. Historical flood data from 2015 to 2019, including 307 flood events, were adopted for a comparison of flood susceptibility. Using these factors, the GANN model, based on the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), was employed to provide flood susceptibility. The validation results indicate that a satisfactory result, with a correlation coefficient of 0.814, was obtained. A comparison of the GANN model with those from the SOBEK model was conducted. The comparative results demonstrated that the proposed method can provide good accuracy in predicting flood susceptibility. The results of flood susceptibility are categorized into five classes: Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, with coverage areas of 60.5%, 27.4%, 8.6%, 2.5%, and 1%, respectively. The results demonstrate that nearly 3.5% of the study area, including the core district of the city and an exceedingly populated area including the financial center of the city, can be categorized as high to very high flood susceptibility zones. © 2021 by the authors.

Among undesirable impacts, emphasis must be put on the risk of information security (ISec) breaches, as they pose a potential threat to businesses there. Especially for publicly traded firms, they could create a long-lasting influence on their financial performance and, thus, stock investors’ confidence. Following the efficient market hypothesis’s footsteps, previous studies have examined only the short-run impact on investors’ confidence ensuing to ISec breach announcements. Therefore, this study investigates the long-run impact of ISec breach announcements on investors’ confidence. Based on a sample of 73 ISec breach announcements during 2011–2019, this paper examines the impact on investors’ confidence, as demonstrated by long-run abnormal returns and equity risk of those firms. Using a one-to-one matched sampling approach, each firm’s performance is analyzed with its control firm over eighteen months, starting six months before the announcement, through twelve months after the announcement. Firms experienced a significant negative abnormal return of 15% to 18% during the twelve months following the breach announcement. In comparison, equity risk increased by 11% within six months before and after an announcement.

Most of these problems do not have analytical solutions, and researchers, therefore, apply numerical approximation methods. This article presents a novel approach to conducting an uncertainty analysis as an alternative to the computationally burdensome Monte Carlo-based (MC) methods. The developed method is based on the degree three Gaussian quadrature (GQ) formulae and is tested using three large-scale simulation models.

River-floodplain system is particularly adversely affected by the reduction in lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC), representing one of major biodiversity hotspots under increasingly pressure. Many studies have demonstrated that LHC has great influence on the spatial variations of flora and fauna communities (i.e. spatial ? diversity) through facilitating dispersal. However, to fully understand the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on biodiversity, we must also understand how ecological communities change over time (i.e. temporal ? diversity, TBI) and the underlying processes. To evaluate the processes structuring ecological communities, we examined the macroinvertebrate TBI in habitats along the gradient of LHC for an entire hydrological cycle in West Dongting Lake, a Ramsar-listed floodplain wetland at the middle reach of Yangtze River. Our results showed that the total spatial ? diversity fluctuated with water level and peaked at high-water phase, and LHC was the driving forcing affecting both species richness and abundance in all hydrological periods. In particular, species richness and abundance were highest in habitats with medium LHC levels for water-rising and high-water periods reflecting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis except for water-recessing, during which there was no clear pattern. While replacement determined ? diversity in most sites at water-rising and high-water phases, the contribution of nestedness were high during water-withdrawing phase. From water-rising to high-water, macroinvertebrates from other habitats spread to the modified mudflats, which had the lowest LHC, along with the floods. During water-withdrawing period, ? diversity and its turnover component of all habitats were low compared with other hydrological phases. Temporal ? diversity analysis illustrated that the species dispersal was the main mechanism underlying the temporal and spatial variations in the observed community patterns. These findings demonstrated that hydrological connectivity was critical to maintaining the ecological integrity of river-floodplain ecosystems. © 2020 The Authors",B-C plots; Dispersal ability; Hydrological connectivity; Nestedness; Turnover,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094842166

OBL is a machine learning concept to accelerate the convergence of soft computing algorithms, which consists of simultaneously calculating an original solution and its opposite. Recently, a stochastic OBL variant called BetaCOBL was proposed, which is capable of controlling the degree of opposite solutions, preserving useful information held by original solutions, and preventing the waste of fitness evaluations. While it has shown outstanding performance compared to several state-of-the-art OBL variants, the high computational cost of BetaCOBL may hinder it from cost-sensitive optimization problems. Also, as it assumes that the decision variables of a given problem are independent, BetaCOBL may be ineffective for optimizing inseparable problems. In this paper, we propose an improved BetaCOBL that mitigates all the limitations. The proposed algorithm called iBetaCOBL reduces the computational cost from O(NP2 · D) to O(NP · D) (NP and D stand for population size and a dimension, respectively) using a linear time diversity measure. Also, the proposed algorithm preserves strongly dependent variables that are adjacent to each other using multiple exponential crossover. We used differential evolution (DE) variants to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results of the performance evaluations on a set of 58 test functions show the excellent performance of iBetaCOBL compared to ten state-of-the-art OBL variants, including BetaCOBL. © 2020",Artificial intelligence; Differential evolution; Evolutionary algorithms; Numerical optimization; Opposition-Based learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091494202

The mainstream scholarship on these initiatives has mostly focused on technology and corporate-led urban development, and it also often privileges the experience of cities in the global North. Nevertheless, this mainstream understanding of the smart city may obscure emerging new power dynamics and locally contextualised processes associated with smart urban development, especially in cities at the global periphery. Inspired by post-colonial theories, this article makes the case for ‘provincialising’ smart urbanism by dislodging technology from the centre of analysis, accentuating perspectives of cities outside the locations where the smart city knowledge is traditionally produced and attending to power relationships. In our case study of Taipei, this provincialising approach helps unveil various logics, intentionalities, assemblages and power dynamics through which the smart city is employed as a political strategy to facilitate urban regime transition. We argue that the current non-affiliated Ko administration exploits the veneer of technological superiority and political neutrality of its smart city agenda to set a new growth agenda, form new development coalitions, establish new institutions and incorporate rising populist momentum into policy-making. Focusing on the politics of being smart, our findings illustrate how smart city experiments reshape power dynamics and regime formation through reorganising actors and interest groups, reconfiguring government institutions, reallocating resource distribution and, in the end, bolstering governing legitimacy. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.",provincialising; smart city; Taipei; urban regime transition,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090992775

In a system designed after swarm intelligence, each agent acts autonomously, reacts on dynamic inputs, and, implicitly or explicitly, works collaboratively with other swarm members without a central control. The system as a whole is expected to exhibit global patterns and behaviors. Although well-designed swarms can show advantages in adaptability, robustness, and scalability, it must be noted that SI system have not really found their way from lab demonstrations to real-world applications, so far. This is particularly true for embodied SI, where the agents are physical entities, such as in swarm robotics scenarios. In this paper, we start from these observations, outline different definitions and characterizations, and then discuss present challenges in the perspective of future use of swarm intelligence. These include application ideas, research topics, and new sources of inspiration from biology, physics, and human cognition. To motivate future applications of swarms, we make use of the notion of cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPSs are a way to encompass the large spectrum of technologies including robotics, internet of things (IoT), Systems on Chip (SoC), embedded systems, and so on. Thereby, we give concrete examples for visionary applications and their challenges representing the physical embodiment of swarm intelligence in autonomous driving and smart traffic, emergency response, environmental monitoring, electric energy grids, space missions, medical applications, and human networks. We do not aim to provide new solutions for the swarm intelligence or CPS community, but rather build a bridge between these two communities. This allows us to view the research problems of swarm intelligence from a broader perspective and motivate future research activities in modeling, design, validation/verification, and human-in-the-loop concepts. © 2020",Cyber-physical systems; Swarm intelligence; Swarm robotics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090005022

Continuous improvement (CI), as an underlying foundation for quality management, is an ongoing effort allowing manufacturing companies to see beyond the present to create a bright future. We propose a novel integrated fuzzy framework for analyzing the barriers to the implementation of CI in manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach: We use the fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and a fuzzy Shannon's entropy to identify and weigh the most significant barriers. We then use fuzzy multi-objective optimization based on ratio analysis (MOORA), the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy simple additive weighting (SAW) methods for prioritizing and ranking the barriers with each method. Finally, we aggregate these results with Copeland's method and extract the main CI implementation barriers in manufacturing. Findings: We show “low cooperation and integration of the team in CI activities” is the most important barrier in CI implementation. Other important barriers are “limited management support in CI activities,” “low employee involvement in CI activities,” “weak communication system in the organization,” and “lack of knowledge in the organization to implement CI projects.” Originality/value: We initially identify the barriers to the implementation of CI through rigorous literature review and then apply a unique integrated fuzzy approach to identify the most important barriers based on the opinions of industry experts and academics. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Continuous improvement; Copeland's method; Failure mode and effect analysis; Fuzzy logic; Shannon's entropy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082932460

The proven effectiveness of P2P sharing in benefiting both prosumers and the grid has been demonstrated in many studies and pilot projects. However, there is still no extensive implementation of such sharing models in today's electricity markets.

In the development and construction of ecotourism in ecologically fragile areas, however, conflicts of interest between stakeholders often negatively affect the efficiency and effectiveness of ecotourism construction. This paper applied evolutionary game theory to analyse the evolutionary stable strategies of local governments, tourism enterprises and residents in the development and construction of ecotourism in ecologically fragile areas, to explore the mechanism that influences the sustainable development policies. The evolutionary stable strategies of the game were calculated and the dynamic simulation of the model was also discussed by using a system dynamics method to analyse the stability of interaction among the stakeholders and determine an equilibrium solution. The simulation results showed that the strategic choices of the three stakeholders fluctuate repeatedly, which indicated that there was no evolutionary stability strategy in the interaction among the current stakeholders. Therefore, an optimized dynamic penalty-incentive control method was proposed to control the fluctuation, after which the simulation results showed that the optimized dynamic penalty-incentive control method can not only effectively suppress the fluctuation but also obtain an ideal evolutionary stable strategy. Then, the cooperation mode can be changed from any original status into the desired target.

We hypothesized hotel service employees’ EI and ED can be influential factors to SS. Adopting the Mehrabian-Russell model (M-R) and Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework as conceptual paradigms, we tested the effect of hotel ambiance on employees’ emotions, which can have significant effects on SS. The study revealed that ES links to behaviors and elicits EI and ED as human emotional responses to environments that have a parallel mediating effect on mitigating or neutralizing the negative effect of SS in an organization. The findings provide important insights into an organization’s awareness of the provision of ES as a positive factor for employees, subsequently forming their behavioral consequences of EI and ED which can mitigate the negative impacts of SS.

However, it is general that the number of government officials in charge of these tasks is few. Although the government has been commissioning a study related to river management to experts, it has been inevitable to avoid the consumption of a massive budget because the characteristics of pollutant loads present various patterns according to topographic of the watershed, such as topology like South Korea. To address this, previous studies have used conceptual and empirical models and have recently used artificial neural network models. The conceptual model has a shortcoming in which it required massive data and has vexatious that has to enforce the sensitivity and uncertain analysis. The empirical model and artificial neural network (ANN) need lower data than a conceptual model; however, these models have a flaw that could not reflect the topographical characteristic.

Therefore, in this paper we propose a stereoscopic Human Action Recognition (HAR) system based on the fusion of RGB (red, green, blue) and depth sensors. These sensors give an extra depth of information which enables the three-dimensional (3D) tracking of each and every movement performed by humans. Human actions are tracked according to four features, namely, (1) geodesic distance; (2) 3D Cartesian-plane features; (3) joints Motion Capture (MOCAP) features and (4) way-points trajectory generation. In order to represent these features in an optimized form, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied. After optimization, a neuro-fuzzy classifier is used for classification and recognition. Extensive experimentation is performed on three challenging datasets: A Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset; a UoL (University of Lincoln) 3D social activity dataset and a Collective Activity Dataset (CAD). Evaluation experiments on the proposed system proved that a fusion of vision sensors along with our unique features is an efficient approach towards developing a robust HAR system, having achieved a mean accuracy of 93.5% with the NTU RGB+D dataset, 92.2% with the UoL dataset and 89.6% with the Collective Activity dataset. The developed system can play a significant role in many computer vision-based applications, such as intelligent homes, offices and hospitals, and surveillance systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Good system frequency observation is vital for system security and pro-tection. This paper analyses the system frequency response following disturbances and proposes a data-driven approach for predicting it by using machine learning techniques like Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) Neural Networks (NN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks from simulated and measured Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data. The proposed method uses a horizon-window that reconstructs the frequency input time-series data in order to predict the frequency features such as Nadir. Simulated scenarios are based on the gradual inertia reduction by including non-synchronous generation into the Nordic 32 test system, whereas the PMU collected data is taken from different locations in the Nordic Power System (NPS). Several horizon-windows are experimented in order to observe an adequate margin of prediction. Scenarios considering noisy signals are also evaluated in order to provide a robustness index of predictability. Results show the proper performance of the method and the adequate level of prediction based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) index. © 2021 by the authors.",Deep learning; Frequency response; Low-inertia power systems; Machine learning; Nadir estimation; Non-synchronous generation; Primary frequency control; Wind power,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099418991

Airports strive to maximize passenger satisfaction as well as optimize their operation. However, the lack of knowledge of consumer preferences might be an important barrier to achieve these objectives. Therefore, our study aims to unveil the potential of service development alternatives based on artificial intelligence (AI). For this, a systematic literature review (SLR) and a quantitative analysis of a survey have been conducted. The results of the empirical research are based on 593 responses; most of the subjects belong to generation Z (digital natives) and Y (millennials). The analysis revealed attitudes towards different AI-based transport solutions and AI robots that provide information at the airports. Based on the perceived attractiveness of such services, the environmentally conscious behaviour of consumers, and sociodemographic data, subjects were classified into three different clusters (Negligents, AV Enthusiasts, and Robot Fanatics). Results proved the attractiveness of AI-based transport services that can be used in the air-side zone. Among the millennials, the idea of self-driving buses running between airport terminals is the most appealing. Greater interest in AI-based communication solutions can be perceived among generation Z. For both generations, environmentally conscious consumption is also of paramount importance. The attractiveness of AI-based solutions has been analyzed in a tourist environment, which might be a good starting point for further research into the technology acceptance of AI-based services. © 2021 by the authors.

We report on experimental results with MD5 and SHA-3 hash functions for two covert channel variants running in a localhost setup.

To develop rural areas, tourism is especially important and need to be improved in these areas. The Government of Br?ko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina has decided to have tourism improvement as one of main objectives in their development strategy focusing on better conditions for development of tourism. Investments in tourism should be applied to the entire area of the Br?ko District. Since Br?ko District mainly consists of rural areas, it is necessary to invest in rural tourism. The first step of this study was to determine the tourist potential of rural areas. The determination of rural tourist potential in Br?ko District was carried out with the assistance of the Br?ko District Government. For this purpose, the method of expert decision-making was used, and three experts were selected who evaluated six rural settlements. To obtain results based on expert evaluation, two multi-criteria methods were used: the Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) for determining the importance of criteria and the fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method to rank rural settlements in terms of their tourism potential. The results showed that the settlement of Bijela has the best rural tourist potential, while the settlement of Grbavica has the least potential. The results obtained by applying this model showed how rural tourism in Br?ko District can be improved. The research model for testing the tourism potential has shown good results and can be applied in other branches of tourism with some adaptation to certain branches of tourism. © 2021 by the authors.

This study answers the question of 'Which tokenization strategy enhances the characteristics of the Korean language for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task based on a language model?' focusing on tokenization, which significantly affects the quality of input features. We present two significant challenges for the NER task with the agglutinative characteristics in the Korean language. Next, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the coping process of each tokenization strategy for these challenges. By adopting various linguistic segmentation such as morpheme, syllable and subcharacter, we demonstrate the effectiveness and prove the performance between PLMs based on each tokenization strategy.

The corner points in the checkerboard images are used as useful features for correspondence matching. Therefore, it is essential to precisely find the corner points in the checkerboard images. In many previous works, the corner points are extracted assuming that the checkerboard images are not distorted by its lens. Instead, image blurring and Gaussian noise on the images are usually considered, but other cases are not dealt with. However, the captured checkerboard images are often corrupted by lens distortions and compression artifacts, which leads to performance degradation of corner point extraction. Moreover, the corner points are extracted individually in the previous methods without considering their geometric relations. To better handle the corner point extraction problem under lens distortions, in our corner point extraction optimization, the distorted locations of the pixels on checkerboard images are corrected with the camera parameters, and the structural constraints for checkerboard image grids are then applied under the line-to-line mapping. Also, to robustly find the blurred edges between corner points due to JPEG compression, an edge surface model is newly proposed that models the transitions with over- and under-shoots around the blurred edges. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method with average 88.3% and 54.3% reduction in RMSE for corner point reprojection and camera parameter estimation, respectively under compression and lens distortions for synthetic and real data. © 2013 IEEE.",camera calibration; compression distortion; Corner point extraction; lens distortion; structural information,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119718490

This paper conducts a newsworthy inquiry purposing to study at which extent IT community are conscious about energy evaluation of their hardware and software implementations, and whether they are in line with sustainable implications toward efficient AI and BD deployments. Through an analysis of responses to the first inquiry questions, we were able to address the residing interoperability between AI models, distributed BD frameworks, and cloud-fog systems. Unfortunately, only 10% of respondents were adopting energy metrics when evaluating their implementations. Even worse, multi-level energy consumption measurement techniques were not evident to most respondents. Accordingly, we provided a useful guideline of various multi-level energy and power estimation approaches. Hereafter, we devoted in accordance with both inquiry and literature results some essential parts for analyzing emerging efficient DNNs and distributed BD implementations. These endeavors were mainly manifested in the form of efficient reconfigurable accelerators designs based on Processing-In-Memory and Processing-Near-Memory architectures.

The dam is located in the Belaga District of Sarawak, approximately 50 km from the active Tubau and Bukit Mersing fault lines. This area experienced earthquakes of magnitudes ranging between 3.5 and 5.4 during the period from 1994 and 2010. This study used global and local earthquake records to evaluate the site-specific seismic hazard using a 1-D equivalent linear analysis. SPT data from 15 boreholes are utilized. Soil flexibility, factor of safety, liquefaction probability and potential index are evaluated to find the ground settlement and soil liquefaction effects. The results show that the ground amplification of Belaga District is between 2.445 and 5.146, while the peak ground accelerations (PGA) at ground surface are at a maximum average of 0.25g PGA. The soil factors for Bakun District range from 2.6 - 3.0, for 2% POE in 50 years. This corresponds to a 2475-year return period. The response spectra are found matching with the target design response spectra for Sarawak as reported in the Malaysia National Annex (MS EN 1998-1:2015). The effects of soil liquefaction are found to be insignificant, as a result the nearby Bakun HEP dam is considered safe from any ground settlement. This study highlights the importance of evaluating the ability of new or existing structures in Belaga District to withstand up to 0.25g PGA in case any seismic event should occur in the future. © 2021.

This study employed a concept analysis. The literature from July 2011 to June 2021 was sought from databases using specific keywords. Any quantitative or qualitative study published in English or Korean focusing on companion robots for older adults was included in the study. Rodgers’ evolutionary concept analysis was used to clarify the antecedents, attributes, and consequences. Seventy-five eligible articles were studied. The findings were categorized into antecedents, attributes, and consequences. Companion robot antecedents were classified into individual factors, attitude toward robots, and caregiver and social factors. The defining attributes included human–robot interaction, function, features, structure, cost, and management of the robot being a companion. Consequences were categorized into user, caregiver, and health related. Companion robots are designed to enhance well-being, quality of life, and independence by providing service and companionship and assisting daily life. This mainly includes cognitive and social support, mobility support, relaxation, health monitoring, and self-care support through human–robot interaction.

One of these options is the use of eco-friendly cars produced by various manufacturers. Given the many available options and conflicting evaluation criteria, evaluation of such options becomes complex, and different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches have been used to select the most suitable car in terms of eco-friendly car selection. Previous research has been somewhat limited with respect to consideration of interdependencies between evaluation criteria and multi-levels of preference. This paper proposes a new integrated MCDM approach with the capability for considering interdependent criteria for eco-friendly car evaluation and different levels of preference. An analytic network process (ANP) will be used to evaluate the levels of importance of interdependent criteria, and ELECTRE III will be modeled to include thresholds of preference. The introduced model, based on twenty-eight evaluation criteria, was demonstrated in a case study dealing with five alternative electric and hybrid cars. The results from this model were compared to a traditional decision-making method and better results were obtained from the model. The model can help users make proper decisions regarding their future car options in a comprehensive manner. Sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of the model under different setups. © 2021 University of Kuwait.

There exist several strategies in machine learning to deal with the multi-class classification problems for attack detection. One of the popular strategies is the one-vs-one that decomposes the multi-class problem into multiple binary ones. The approach has been applied in many popular supervised learning algorithms, such as support vector machines. A possible problem of the standard multi-class classification problem is that it lacks correlation between different classes, which can increase overfitting problems and hinder generalization performance. Thus, a possible solution to the problem is to use a hierarchical classification that captures the relationship between classes by dividing the multi-class classification problem into a tree. However, one possible challenge in this approach is selecting parent and child nodes of the tree. The selected nodes should be informative to recognize and then classify different attack classes. One way is by looking at specific domain knowledge to train and build classifiers of the base learners for effective prediction. Thus, a soft marking scheme is introduced to assess a set of binary classifiers to ensure the best overall predictive base learners. Finally, we validate and compare the proposed approach to the standard NSL-KDD dataset. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the standard classifier on the intrusion attack classification. © 2021 Azizi Abdullah and Warhamni Jani@Mokhtar.

Nevertheless, mobile applications specific to Malay language learning for non-native speakers with relevant materials are still lacking. Moreover, expert reviews are needed to identify usability issues and check whether such applications can meet the learning goal with relevant materials features. This study developed an augmented reality (AR)-based mobile application called RakanBM for learning the Malay language (i.e. the language officially spoken in Malaysia), and then performed an expert review on the application contents, text presentations, learning outcomes, assessments, effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The expert review was conducted by a panel of six experts from two specific fields, namely the Malay language and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), using methods such as cognitive walkthrough (CW), semi-structured interviews, think-aloud protocols, and survey. The results from CW, semi-structured interviews, think-aloud protocols shows that enhancement was needed on user interface and user experience in term of aesthetic and interactivity. The survey results were classified into two levels: high (mean > 4.0) and satisfied (mean > 3.5). Application factors that were recorded as satisfied were the application contents, text presentations, and satisfaction, while the factors recorded as high were the learning outcomes, assessments, effectiveness, and efficiency. The comments or suggestions for improvement were mainly around the contents of the application. Nevertheless, the application received good comments on its usefulness and the topics covered, which were suitable and best for non-native speakers. The findings of this study can guide developers and researchers in the development of future applications that can support language learning for non-native speakers in particular. © 2021, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

One of the key problems has been to understand the diffusion processes of the virus, which quickly spread worldwide through transport networks, mainly air flights. Almost two years after start the pandemic, it is necessary to collect and synthesize the existing work on this matter. This work focuses on studies related to the COVID-19 contagion simulation through transport networks. In particular, we are specially interested in the different datasets and epidemiological models used. The search methodology consists of four exhaustive searches in Google Scholar carried out between January 2020 and January 2021. Of the 1786 findings, we chose 54 articles related to Covid-19 contagion modeling and simulation through transport networks. The results show 30 different data sources for the collection of air flights and 11 additional sources for maritime and land transport. These datasets are usually complemented with other data sources, local and international, with demographic information, economic data, and statistics of traceability of the pandemic. The findings also found 15 spread models of contagion, with the SEIR model being the most widely used, followed by mathematical-based risk models. This diversity of results validates the need for these types of compilation efforts since researchers do not have a single centralized repository to collect air flight data. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Due to the significant number, variety and distribution of electrical network overhead line assets, energy network operators spend millions annually on inspection and maintenance programmes. Currently, inspection involves acquiring and manually analysing aerial images. This is labour intensive and subjective. Along with costs associated with helicopter or drone operations, data analysis represents a significant financial burden to network operators. We propose an approach to automating assessment of the condition of electrical towers. Importantly, we train machine learning tower classifiers without using condition labels for individual components of interest. Instead, learning is supervised using only condition labels for towers in their entirety. This enables us to use a real-world industry dataset without needing costly additional human labelling of thousands of individual components. Our prototype first detects instances of components in multiple images of each tower, using Mask R-CNN or RetinaNet. It then predicts tower condition ratings using one of two approaches: (i) component instance classifiers trained using class labels transferred from towers to each of their detected component instances, or (ii) multiple instance learning classifiers based on bags of detected instances. Instance or bag class predictions are aggregated to obtain tower condition ratings. Evaluation used a dataset with representative tower images and associated condition ratings covering a range of component types, scenes, environmental conditions, and viewpoints. We report experiments investigating classification of towers based on the condition of their multiple insulator and U-bolt components. Insulators and their U-bolts were detected with average precision of 96.7 and 97.9, respectively. Tower classification achieved areas under ROC curves of 0.94 and 0.98 for insulator condition and U-bolt condition ratings, respectively. Thus we demonstrate that tower condition classifiers can be trained effectively without labelling the condition of individual components. © 2013 IEEE.",asset management; image classification; machine learning; Pattern recognition; power transmission,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118570082

Sediment transport in a river basin is therefore a multifaceted field yet being a dynamic task in nature. It is characterized by high stochasticity, non-linearity, non-stationarity, and feature redundancy. Various artificial intelligence (AI) modeling frameworks have been introduced to solve river sediment problems. The present survey is designed to provide an updated account of the latest and most relevant AI-based applications for modeling the sediment transport in river basin systems. The review is established to capture the subsequent developments in the advanced AI models applied for river sediment transport prediction. Also, several hydrological and environmental aspects are identified and analyzed according to the results produced in those studies. The merits and constraints of the well-established AI models are further discussed in much detail, particularly considering state-of-the art, modeling frameworks and their application-specific appraisal, and some of the key proposed future research directions.

Islanding detection becomes problematic especially when the local generation matches or closely matches the local load. Therefore, there are strict requirements for accurate, fast, and reliable islanding detection of renewables and DG-based systems. Various islanding schemes have been proposed in the literature, which can be categorized as remote, local, and intelligent-classifier-based schemes. Recently, intelligent schemes have gained attention due to their superior properties and advantages relative to traditional approaches. This paper overviews the shift in research from traditional schemes to intelligent islanding schemes. It also highlights the major obstacles, challenges, advantages and disadvantages, and future research directions of intelligent schemes. In this study, the intelligent-classifier-based islanding detection schemes presented over the last decade are analyzed objectively and comprehensively from all aspects of islanding detection.

Like any other research topic, NoC inevitably goes through its life cycle: A. it started up (2000-2007) and quickly gained traction in its own right; B. it then entered the phase of growth and shakeout (2008-2013) with the research outcomes peaked in 2010 and remained high for another four/five years; C. NoC research was considered mature and stable (2014-2020), with signs showing a steady slowdown. Although from time to time, excellent survey articles on different subjects/aspects of NoC appeared in the open literature, yet there is no general consensus on where we are in this NoC roadmap and where we are heading, largely due to lack of an overarching methodology and tool to assess and quantify the research outcomes and evolution. In this paper, we address this issue from the perspective of three specific complex networks, namely the citation network, the subject citation network, and the co-authorship network. The network structure parameters (e.g., modularity, diameter, etc.) and graph dynamics of the three networks are extracted and analyzed, which helps reveal and explain the reasons and the driving forces behind all the changes observed in NoC research over 20 years. Additional analyses are performed in this study to link interesting phenomena surrounding the NoC area. They include: (1) relationships between communities in citation networks and NoC subjects, (2) measure and visualization of a subject's influence score and its evolution, (3) knowledge flow among the six most popular NoC subjects and their relationships, (4) evolution of various subjects in terms of number of publications, (5) collaboration patterns and cross-community collaboration among the authors in NoC research, (6) interesting observation of career lifetime and productivity among NoC researchers, and finally (7) investigation of whether or not new authors are chasing hot subjects in NoC.

It refers to the phase of life when a person leaves his job and withdraws from active working life. Proper optimization of retirement is only possible when a person has pre planned his life with proper finances and saving or the government is providing him with a lot of social security benefits. However, such conditions rarely occur as a person is preoccupied in his pre retirement phases. But proper optimization of retirement can also take place when a person has high social intelligence which affects physical and mental health. Hence, this paper is an endeavor to look into the relevance of social intelligence which helps the people in their retirement process in the people. Thus, a survey was done to find the level of Social Intelligence in the people who are ageing and are going to be retired soon. Around 252 people between 55 to 70 years were studied from Delhi and NCR. The result indicated that middle aged and just retired people had high social intelligence as compared to older adults and the former were also able to optimize their retirement effectively for successful ageing. The older adults were not able to cope up with the various issues of retirement due to low social intelligence. Hence, further studies can be carried out to design proper training for enhancement of social intelligence in aged people for their effective optimization of retirement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Just retired; Middle aged; Older adults; Optimization; Retirement; Socialintelligence,Article,Article in Press,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118431953

The purpose of this paper was to explore the implications of the laytime and demurrage provisions when using existing charterparties and to suggest how the areas where charterers are exposed to demurrage can be addressed and thus improve sustainability. A comparative analysis was conducted on selected standard voyage charterparties. The findings revealed various areas that do not protect a charterer's interest. It is proposed that in order to solve this challenge a global group consisting of stakeholders be formed to collectively design laytime and demurrage clauses in order to achieve greater sustainability and reduce demurrage.

The recent development of microsensor devices is distributed in a real-world terrestrial environment to sense various environmental changes. The energy consumption of the remotely deployed microsystems depends on its utilization efficiency. Improper utilization of sensor nodes' heterogeneity could lead to uneven energy consumption and load imbalance across the network, which will degrade the performance of the network. The proposed heterogeneous energy and traffic aware (HETA) considers the key parameters such as delay, throughput, traffic load, energy consumption, and life span. The residual energy and a minimum distance between the base station and cluster members are taken into consideration for the cluster head selection. The probability of hitting data traffic has been utilized to analyse energy and traffic towards the base station. The role of the sensor node has been realized and priority-based data forwarding are also proposed. As a result, the heterogeneous energy and traffic aware perform well in balancing traffic towards the base station, which is analysed in terms of maximum throughput and increase in a lifetime of heterogeneous energy networks more than 5000 rounds, and the algorithm outperforms 34.5% of nodes are alive with transmissible energy. The proposed research also endorses unequal clustering and minimum energy consumption. We have modeled our proposed research using various p-type junctionless nanowire FET without doping injunctions.

DL is capable of learning the underlying characteristics of radio signals effectively for modulation pattern recognition, which in turn improves the modulation classification performance under the presence of channel impairments. In this work, we first provide the fundamental concepts of various architectures, such as neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural networks as the necessary background. We then convey a comprehensive study of DL for AMC in wireless communications, where technical analysis is deliberated in the perspective of state-of-the-art deep architectures. Remarkably, several sophisticated structures and advanced designs of convolutional neural networks are investigated for different data types of sequential radio signals, spectrum images, and constellation images to deal with various channel impairments.

AI methods can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for the better decision-making processes, and it further increases the overall usability of the system. AIoT frameworks are very useful and applicable in a variety of applications, like security and surveillance system, smart home, intelligent transportation system, smart farming, secure and safe healthcare monitoring, industrial automation and control, eCommerce, logistics operations and control, and many more. However, AIoT frameworks may have issues related to data security and privacy as they are vulnerable to various types of information security-related attacks. These issues further cause the serious consequences, like the unauthorized data leakage and data update. Blockchain is a specific type of database. It is a digital ledger of transactions, which is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems. It stores data in the form of some blocks, which are then chained together.

The increased penetration leads to several technical problems on existing networks and impacts utilities' business models as energy sales drop. For proactive management of these challenges, utilities need to continually monitor the capacity of installed PV. To this end, some utilities typically require PV installations to be registered and sometimes use GIS mapping to approximate the installed PV capacity. However, these GIS PV capacity estimations methods are unreliable. Therefore, to obtain reliable PV estimates at a distribution level, comprehensive modeling is required to accurately represent the generation output and the distribution load. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic PV estimation method that uses time-series historical sets of load and irradiance data to estimate the embedded PV capacity while considering the uncertainty in solar irradiance and the measured net load. Uncertainty characterization is implemented using empirical probability density functions, and simulation is performed stochastically using Monte-Carlo simulation methods. A novel quantile analysis approach is developed and used in the computation of the final capacity of PV. The proposed methodology is tested using measured load data from Ausgrid customers, Australia, and achieves reasonable accuracy (between 86% and 90% for the tested cases) and a 10% mean absolute percentage error. This approach is robust to the effects of input uncertainty and can be used by distribution utilities to estimate and monitor PV capacity installed on the distribution networks without incurring extra advanced metering investment costs. © 2013 IEEE.",Disaggregation; Monte-Carlo simulation; photovoltaic systems; probability density function; quantile analysis,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117305733

The protocol employs PUFs technology to allow each Thing to uniquely identify and authenticate itself in an IoT infrastructure by using the physical randomness of its circuitry.

In commemoration of this event, we use a bibliometric analysis to present a retrospective on the journal by analyzing its content for the years between 2006 and 2020. We find that the collaboration culture in MIR has risen over time with the increase in the median size of author teams. Moreover, the collaboration network has become more global over time. The methodology used in the journal is predominantly empirical and quantitative with archival data sources most commonly used. The bibliographic coupling of the MIR corpus reveals that the major themes in the journal revolve around “culture,” “emerging economies,” “innovation, knowledge transfer, and absorptive capacity,” “internationalization process,” “culture and entry modes,” and “internationalization and performance.” A comparison with other leading international business journals provides distinct pathways in which MIR may continue to grow. Finally, it is important to note that while the share of conceptual studies has decreased significantly in the last 15 years, the MIR editors want to see more novel and theoretically grounded conceptual articles in the journal. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bibliographic coupling; Bibliometric analysis; Co-authorship analysis; International business; International management,Review,Article in Press,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117082989

The proposed framework addresses the gaps in policymaking, the role of all stakeholders, and uses historical data of crop production in different sectors of land in optimizing the profits that shall meet the defined constraints including national requirement, and export demand of different crops. There are many agro-economy-based countries where agriculture is the main contributor to their GDP, while there are others who always struggle to meet their national need while optimizing the agro-economy component of their earnings. Crops are not always produced with keeping the demand and production balance. Rather, the crops are mostly produced according to the farmer's ease and last year's prices for profit maximization leading to excessive production of one type of crop, lowering of profit margins, and shortage of some key crops for national need. This paper presents a decision aiding tool that can be used for farmer's awareness for crop production planning that meets the national and export needs while maximizing farmer's earnings. The model is tested on historical data of different segments of cultivated lands in Pakistan for validation, with the first experiment performed on single farmland with multi-fields while the second performed for multi-locations and multi-fields. The results are promising and provide estimates of net profit, expected production against the demand for each crop, and analysis that aids in crop planning, before and after the application of our model while meeting all necessary constraints. © 2013 IEEE.",Agriculture; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Optimization; Planning; Prediction methods; Yield estimation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116971915

Thus, this paper aims to identify the significance of sustainable consumption behavior and theoretically conceptualize SCBOEI. This study employs content and text analysis to reconceptualize the major theories that contribute to the research of SCB. The findings in this study show that SCBOEI is contributed of great significance to promote sustainable development. In addition, this study introduces a model of SCBOEI, in which the consumer value theory, social exchange theory, and planned behavior theory are integrated. Additionally, this paper suggests that value, environmental attitude, identity, consumer engagement, and contextual factors (government behavior, market conditions, and environmental education) are highly important to extend the research on SCBOEI. In conclusion, this study strongly recommends that SCB research shall be directed to the online education industry.

However, the industry has been adjudged as a slow adopter of digital technologies such as big data analytics (BDA) to improve its service delivery. The implication of this slow adoption is the lack of innovativeness and unsustainable project delivery that has characterised the industry in most countries, particularly in developing ones like South Africa. Therefore, this study assessed the intention to adopt BDA by construction organisations using the unified theory of technology adoption and use of technology (UTAUT) model. A post-positivism philosophical stance was employed, which informed the use of quantitative research with a questionnaire designed to solicit information from construction organisations in South Africa. Data analysis was done using Cronbach alpha to test for reliability and Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation to evaluate the impact of the different constructs of the UTAUT on the adoption of BDA by construction organisations in South Africa. The study found that variables relating to facilitating conditions, performance expectancy, and social influence will significantly impact an organisation’s intention to adopt BDA. However, issues surrounding effort expectancy, resistance to use, and perceived risk cannot be overlooked as they also have high impact levels.

This article discusses the structure and dynamics of the development of advanced manufacturing markets, as well as the specifics of the policies of the countries strengthening their positions in these markets, based on the analysis of international trade in products using advanced manufacturing technologies. The study shows that in the last decade there has been a noticeable structural shift in AM: Industry 4.0 is growing faster, and the key growth driver is the biotechnology market. Large innovative economies — USA, France, Japan — are being displaced from AM markets, while new industrialized countries — Korea, Taiwan, and fast-growing China — are becoming leaders. The new AM markets — Industry 4.0 — are characterized by a high concentration of knowledge in universities combined with a high activity of start-ups, while the relatively traditional AM markets — Industry 3.0 — show a higher concentration of production. The position of countries in Industry 4.0 markets is significantly related to the monopoly of new knowledge and the opportunities for its rapid commercialization in start-ups, while in Industry 3.0 markets the processes of leading firms’ specialization and use of scale are already more significant, and the research environment is becoming more competitive. Strengthening and/or optimizing the positions on AM markets becomes the most important challenge for modern industrial policy. On the one hand, the choice of target markets determines significant alternatives in industrial policy (e.g., betting on the creation of new knowledge or on the spread of advanced technology), on the other hand, the sensitivity of progress to the complementarity of changes forms the demand for a comprehensive industrial policy, combining elements of science and technology, innovation, investment, and human capital development policies. © 2021 by the authors.",Advanced manufacturing; Biotechnology; Industrial policy; Industry 4.0; Innovation; International trade; New technologies; Strategies,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116331089

The mosquito release ecosystem is dependent of six classes, eggs density, larvae density, pupae density, mosquitoes searching for hosts density, resting mosquito's density and mosquitoes searching for ovipositional site density. An artificial neural network with the layer structure of Morlet wavelet (MWNN) kernel is presented using the global and local search optimization schemes of genetic algorithm (GA) and active-set algorithm (ASA), i.e., MWNN-GA-ASA. The accurateness, reliability and constancy of the proposed MWNN-GA-ASA is established through comparative examinations with Adams method based numerical results to solve the proposed nonlinear system with matching of order 10-06 to 10-09.

The use of AC is already commonplace with platform-based work in the gig economy, where independent workers are paid for completing a given task (or “gig”). The combination of independent work alongside intensive managerial monitoring and guidance via AC raises questions about how gig workers perceive AC practices and judge their legitimacy, which could help explain critical worker behaviours such as turnover and non-compliance. Based on a three-dimensional conceptualisation of micro-level legitimacy tailored to the gig work context (autonomy, fairness, and privacy), we develop a research model that links workers’ perceptions of two predominant forms of AC (gatekeeping and guiding) to their legitimacy judgements and behavioural reactions. Using survey data from 621 Uber drivers, we find empirical support for the central role of micro-level legitimacy judgements in mediating the relationships between gig workers’ perceptions of different AC forms and their continuance intention and workaround use. Contrasting prior work, our study results show that workers do not perceive AC as a universally “bad thing” and that guiding AC is in fact positively related to micro-level legitimacy judgements.

Depending on the characteristics of fire, habitat and taxa affected, fires can cause pain, negative experiences, suffering, and death in individual animals. The impacts of fire have been studied in different branches of ecology, but studies of its effects on the welfare of individual animals remain scarce. The current review aims to synthesize a sample of relevant aspects regarding fire’s negative effects on wild animals. We mainly focus on the immediate impacts of fire on individuals. How animals respond to fire depends on many factors including their life history, evolutionary adaptations to fire, and individual stress coping styles, in addition to the characteristics of the fire. The fundamentals of carrying out future work for animal rescue and prevention of animal harms in fires were also explored. Fires may increase the risk of injury, disease, stress, and mortality for animals living in the wild. Although animal taxa differ significantly from each other, a wide variety of vertebrate species (and perhaps some invertebrates) are capable of experiencing both physical and emotional pain, engaging in substantive relationships, and executing cognitively complex tasks. The consequences of fires can involve suffering, psychological damage, negative experiences, discomfort and pain, and long-term detrimental consequences. Wild animals can benefit from effective rescue, rehabilitation, and release during fires, and post-release monitoring must accurately evaluate their outcome success. The resulting information can be used to educate veterinarians, rehabilitators, and the public in the prevention of the poor welfare and deaths of as many animals as possible in future fire events, which ultimately benefits animal welfare. This review provides a better understanding of how fire compromises animal welfare, providing an example of how to use the knowledge gathered in animal ecology to examine the welfare of wild animals. It can help raise concern for the situation of wild animals as individuals, and to develop the field of welfare biology, by identifying promising future lines of research. © 2021 Sciendo.

Manual image identification and image recognition were performed with a computer vision application programming interface (API) to recognize networked images. Then, we extracted the sky gardens’ main elements in Singapore’s urban environment using clustering analysis, principal component analysis and factor analysis with SPSS. Finally, we discuss the spatial distribution, role and composition of sky gardens in high-density cities and people’s emotional preferences. The study shows that sky gardens are effective alternative public spaces in Singapore's vertical city, and their physical elements occupy a dominant position in the public’s spatial perception; there is a strong tendency for different buildings’ sky gardens to have spatial demand characteristics, while public facilities and cultural activities are key factors that affect sky gardens’ quality. © 2021 The Author(s).

The largest SNS user group in Malaysia is comprised of university students. However, they are the least contributed group in making donations. This study examines the factors influencing the intentions of students to donate money via SNS. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted, and the data from 216 questionnaires were analysed using multiple linear regression. Using the extended theory of planned behaviour, three constructs, namely, descriptive norm, perceived behavioural control, and Internet technology feature, were found to significantly affecting the intention for online donations. Normalising the majority's performance in a similar reference group and making students feel comfortable sharing their online giving information have positive effects on donation intention via SNS. The young people were also concerned about the Internet functionality to perform monetary donation over SNS. The other two constructs that are, attitude and past behaviour, were not significant towards intention to donate via SNS. The findings offered several suggestions to non-profit organisations to raise the awareness of online giving among students, as to shape them to become future donors for far-reaching decades. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

This level of analysis is the most detailed version that is capable of exploring the nuanced viewpoints of the reviews. The bulk of study in ABSA focuses on English with very little work available in Arabic. Most previous work in Arabic has been based on regular methods of machine learning that mainly depends on a group of rare resources and tools for analyzing and processing Arabic content such as lexicons, but the lack of those resources presents another challenge. In order to address these challenges, Deep Learning (DL)-based methods are proposed using two models based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural networks for ABSA. The first is a DL model that takes advantage of word and character representations by combining bidirectional GRU, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Conditional Random Field (CRF) making up the (BGRU-CNN-CRF) model to extract the main opinionated aspects (OTE). The second is an interactive attention network based on bidirectional GRU (IAN-BGRU) to identify sentiment polarity toward extracted aspects. We evaluated our models using the benchmarked Arabic hotel reviews dataset. The results indicate that the proposed methods are better than baseline research on both tasks having 39.7% enhancement in F1-score for opinion target extraction (T2) and 7.58% in accuracy for aspect-based sentiment polarity classification (T3).

However, the quest for achieving optimal drilling efficiency is ever continued. This paper aims to provide valuable insights into borehole drilling data utilizing the potential of advanced analytics by employing several enhanced cluster analysis techniques to propel drilling efficiency optimization and knowledge discovery. The study proposed an L2-weighted K-mean clustering algorithm in which the mean is computed from transformed weighted feature space. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed L2-weighted K-mean algorithm, we performed a comparative analysis of the proposed work with traditional clustering algorithms to estimate the digging time and depth for different soil materials and land layers. The proposed clustering scheme is evaluated widely used evaluation metrics such as Dunn Index, Davies-Bouldin index (DBI), Silhouette coefficient (SC), and Calinski-Harabaz Index (CHI). The study results highlight the significance of the proposed clustering algorithm as it achieved better clustering results than conventional clustering approaches. Moreover, for facilitation of subsequent learning, achievement of reliable classification, and generalization, we performed feature extraction based on the time interval of the drilling process according to soil material and land layer. We formulated the solution by grouping the extracted features into six different blocks to achieve our desired objective. Each block corresponds to various characteristics of soil materials and land layers. Extracted features are examined and visualized in point cloud space to analyze the water level patterns, depth, and days required to complete the drilling operations. © 2013 IEEE.",Data analysis; features extraction; machine learning; strategic planning and management; unsupervised learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114737499

In this work, we find a correlation between the particulate matter (PM) found indoors and the outside weather with the PEFR. The PEFR results are classified into three categories such as 'Green' (Safe), 'Yellow' (Moderate Risk) and 'Red' (High Risk) conditions in comparison to the best peak flow value obtained by each individual.

Owing to participation of multiple qualitative and quantitative attributes, the low-carbon tourism strategy (LCTS) selection process can be considered as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. As uncertainty is usually occurred in LCTSs evaluation, the theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) has been established as more flexible and efficient tool to model the uncertain decision-making problems. The idea of the present study is to develop an extended method using additive ratio assessment (ARAS) framework and similarity measures in a way to find an effective solution to the decision-making problems using IVIFSs. The bases of the proposed method are the IVIFSs operators, some modifications in the traditional ARAS framework and a calculation procedure of the weights of the criteria. To calculate criterion weight, new similarity measures for IVIFSs are developed aiming at the achievement of more realistic weights. Also, a comparison is demonstrated to the currently used similarity measures in order to show the efficiency of the developed approach. To confirm that the developed IVIF-ARAS approach can be successfully employed to practical decision-making problems, a case study of LCTS selection problem is considered. The final results from the developed approach and the extant models are compared for the validation of the proposed approach in this study. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",ARAS; Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Low-carbon tourism; MCDM; Similarity measure,Article,Article in Press,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114113097

Ignoring the missing values from analyses has been used as a technique to manage it. However, it leads to partial and biased results in data analyses. Instead, filling the data gaps using the reference datasets is a better and widely used approach. Thus, this study was initiated to evaluate the seven gap-filling techniques in daily rainfall datasets in five meteorological stations of Wolaita Zone and the surroundings in South Ethiopia. The considered gap-filling techniques in this study were simple arithmetic means (SAM), normal ratio method (NRM), correlation coefficient weighing (CCW), inverse distance weighting (IDW), multiple linear regression (MLR), empirical quantile mapping (EQM), and empirical quantile mapping plus (EQM+). The techniques were preferred because of their computational simplicity and appreciable accuracies. Their performance was evaluated against mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), skill scores (SS), and Pearson's correlation coefficients (R). The results indicated that MLR outperformed other techniques in all of the five meteorological stations. It showed the lowest RMSE and the highest SS and R in all stations. Four techniques (SAM, NRM, CCW, and IDW) showed similar performance and were second-ranked in all of the stations with little exceptions in time series. EQM+ improved (not substantial) the performance levels of gap-filling techniques in some stations. In general, MLR is suggested to fill in the missing values of the daily rainfall time series. However, the second-ranked techniques could also be used depending on the required time series (period) of each station. The techniques have better performance in stations located in higher altitudes. The authors expect a substantial contribution of this paper to the achievement of sustainable development goal thirteen (climate action) through the provision of gap-filling techniques with better accuracy. © 2021 Alefu Chinasho et al.",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113972622

The conventional social welfare (SW) consists the benefit function of consumers and the cost function of active power generation. In this paper, the conventional SW is modified by including the reactive power cost function. The reactive power cost calculation is exactly same as that in the conventional practice. The most important difference is that instead of doing cost calculation in post-facto manner as in conventional practice, simultaneous approach is proposed in this work. The scientificity and suitability of the proposed simultaneous active and reactive power methodology has been examined on standard IEEE 30 bus test system. © 2021.

Demand side management (DSM) is one of the crucial aspects of smart grid that provides users with the opportunity to optimize their load usage pattern to fill the gap between energy supply and demand and reduce the peak to average ratio (PAR), thus resulting in energy and economic efficiency ultimately. The application of DSM programs is lucrative for both utility and consumers. Utilities can implement DSM programs to improve the system power quality, power reliability, system efficiency, and energy efficiency, while consumers can experience energy savings, reduction in peak demand, and improvement of system load profile, and they can also maximize usage of renewable energy resources (RERs). In this paper, some of the strategies of DSM including peak shaving and load scheduling are highlighted.

Background Higher education institutions (HEIs) have invested heavily in learning management systems (LMSs), such as Moodle and BlackBoard, as these systems enhance students' learning and improve their interactions with the educational systems. While most studies on LMSs have focused on the pre-adoption or acceptance phases of this technology, the determinant factors that influence students' continuance intention to use LMSs have received less attention in the information systems (IS) literature. Methodology The theoretical model for this study was primarily drawn from the expectation-confirmation model (ECM). A total of 387 Kuwaiti students, from a private American University in the State of Kuwait, participated in this study. Partial least squares (PLS) was employed to analyze the data. Contribution This study contributes to the existing scientific knowledge in different ways. First, this study extends the expectation confirmation model (ECM) by integrating factors that are important to students' continuous intention to use LMSs, including system interactivity, effort expectancy, attitude, computer anxiety, self-efficacy, subjective norms, and facilitating conditions. Second, this study adds on a Kuwaiti literature context by focusing on the continuous intention to use LMSs, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that extends and empirically assesses the applicability of the ECM in the LMSs context in a developing country - Kuwait. Third, this study conceptually and empirically differentiates between satisfaction and attitude, as two separate affect constructs, which were taken as interchangeable factors in ECM, and were disregarded by a large number of prior ECM studies concerned with continuous use intention. Finally, this study aims to assist HEIs, faculty members, and systems' developers in understanding the main factors that influence students' continuance use intention of LMSs. Findings While subjective norms were not significant, the results mainly showed that students' continuous intention to use Moodle is significantly influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitude, satisfaction, self-efficacy and facilitating conditions. The study's results also confirmed that satisfaction and attitude are two conceptually and empirically different constructs, conflicting with the views that these constructs can be taken as interchangeable factors in the ECM. Recommendations This study offers several useful practical implications. First, given the significant for Practitioners influence of system interactivity on performance expectancy and satisfaction, faculty members should modify their teaching approach by enabling communication and interaction among instructors, students, and peers using the LMS. Second, given the significant influence of performance expectancy, satisfaction, and attitude on continuous intention to use the LMS, HEIs should conduct training programs for students on the effective use of the LMS. This would increase students' awareness regarding the usefulness of the LMS, enhance their attitude towards the LMS, and improve their satisfaction with the system. Third, given the significant role of effort expectancy in influencing performance expectancy, attitude, and students' continuous intention to use Moodle, developers and system programmers should design the LMS with easy to use, high quality, and customizable user interface. This, in turn, will not only motivate students' performance expectancy, but will also influence their attitude and continuous intention to use the system. Recommendations for Researchers This study conceptually and empirically differentiates between satisfaction and attitude, as two separate affect constructs, which were taken as interchangeable factors in ECM and were disregarded by a large number of prior ECM studies concerned with continuous use intention. Hence, it is recommended that researchers include these two constructs in their research models when investigating continuous intention to use a technology. Impact on Society This study could be used in other countries to compare and verify the results. Additionally, the research model of this study could also be used to investigate other LMSs, such as Blackboard. Future Research This study focused on how different factors affected students' continuous intention to use Moodle but did not consider all determinants of successful system, such as system quality, information quality, and instructional as well as course content quality. Thus, future research should devote attention to the effects of these quality characteristics of LMS. © 2021 Informing Science Institute.

To add to this knowledge, in this paper, a heuristic equation is proposed which relates the correlation coefficient of atmospheric parameters with the number of hourly incidences of thunderstorms. There are four ways to compute the indices values from the proposed heuristic equation. These indices values are used in the classification of the hourly incidences of thunderstorms. The proposed equation and indices work well, as tested on pre-monsoon hourly atmospheric data from 2018 and validated with hourly data from April 2019 and 2020. From the four indices, the first index value is computed with normalized average values of parameters of only hourly incidence of thunderstorms data of 2016-2017 in the month-wise method. The other three indices use optimization techniques namely, the Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) technique, Differential Evaluation (DE), and Simulated Annealing (SA). TLBO shows better classification of hourly incidences of thunderstorms for 2018 atmospheric data. TLBO is also precisely validating the hourly incidences of thunderstorms for April 2019 and April 2020 hourly atmospheric data. It performed better with 2020 data by 88%.

Modern operating systems rely on code signing, which uses a default-valid trust model, for executable files to identify their publishers. A malware could pass software validation of operating systems and security software by using counterfeit code-signing certificates. Although the counterfeit certificates can be revoked by CAs, the previous research showed that the revocation delay takes as long as 5.6 months. In this paper, we attempt to identify the credibility of software with multiple-version executable files without relying on public key infrastructure (PKI), where a new-version executable file is usually developed incrementally based on the previous versions. The sharing features among different versions can be extracted for identifying the software. Accordingly, we present a software-birthmark scheme to serve our purpose. Our scheme generates a cross-version software birthmark for executable files of the same software. The proposed software birthmark is a binary-classification model of a machine learning algorithm based on imported and exported function names extracted from different-version executable files. To evaluate the performance of version-wide software birthmarks, our experiments include 138 versions of Windows kernel32.dll and 545 versions of firefox.exe. We also use multiple machine learning algorithms for performance comparisons. The results show that proposed software birthmark can effectively identify the derivations of these executable files.

UCloD deploys very small clock delays (in the picosecond range) generated using the tapped delays lines (TDLs) to mitigate RPA attacks. UCloD provides the most robust countermeasures demonstrated thus far against RPA attacks. RPA attacks use delay sensors, such as Time to Digital Converters (TDC) or Ring Oscillators (ROs) to measure voltage fluctuations occurring in power delivery networks (PDNs) of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These voltage fluctuations reveal secret information, such as secret keys of cryptographic circuits. The only countermeasure proposed thus far activates ROs to consume significant power and has managed to secure Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) circuits for up to 300,000 encryptions. Using TDLs available in FPGAs, UCloD randomly varies the clock to the cryptographic circuits under attack to induce noise in the adversary's delay sensor(s). We demonstrate correlation power analysis (referred to as CPA) attack resistance of UCloD AES implementations for up to one million encryptions. Compared to an unprotected AES circuit, UCloD implementations have minimal overheads (0.2% Slice LUT overhead and 4.8% Slice register overhead for Xilinx implementations and 0.5% LogicCells overhead for Lattice Semiconductor implementations). © 2013 IEEE.",Cryptography; encryption; security; side-channel attacks,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112623657

The ability to manage and control the change elements on a project, particularly the project scope, is a key to project success. The notion of agile process was introduced to tackle the scope change-related challenges such as scope creep. By adopting an agile-footed process, the development organizations can react to the consistent market changes and client requests. However, continuous change accommodation may negatively impact on the success of the targeted project since the project manager mainly focuses on controlling scope change rather than analyzing its impact on the cost and quality. The agile-process advocates have accepted that this situation could happen even following agile methodology, which prompts on compromising the quality, postponed the plans, increases the cost, plan to modify, and diminished the consumer loyalty. Additionally, the scope-related challenge significantly increases, especially when managing scope creep in Global Software Development (GSD) context. Thus, there is a need to focus on scope creep factors in the context of AGSD. Motivated by this, current work aims at identifying the factors causing scope creep in the context of AGSD. To achieve the targeted objectives, we reported the current state-of-the-art related to existing scope creep models in AGSD context. We performed a systematic literature review and an empirical study to address the formulated research questions. The current study also identifies the additional challenges of scope creep from the industrial perspective. Based on the obtained results, the current work proposes a conceptual model for scope creep to assist the agile practitioners to effectively handle the scope creep, which ultimately increases the project success and forecasts change control effect on a software project.

Parents and teachers play an important role in shaping children’s perceptions via internet mediation behaviours (Livingstone et al., 2017, J. Commun., 67, 82). Aims: An understanding of both children’s and adults’ perceptions of the risks and benefits of SNS use within the home and school contexts is limited within current literature. This study explored parents’, teachers’, and children’s perceptions of the risks and benefits of SNS use and how adults mediate this. Sample(s): A sample of 42 participants, including 13 parents (aged 28–48), 14 teachers (aged 26–54), and 15 children (aged 7–12), participated within this study. Methods: Participants took part in one-to-one semi-structured interviews exploring SNS use and risk and benefit perceptions, as well as internet mediation behaviours with adult participants. Results: Findings highlight bonding social capital as the main benefit. Children recognize stranger danger as a risk but fail to perceive the wider online risks (e.g., cyberbullying). Parents’ and teachers’ restrictive mediation behaviours are informed by perceptions of stranger danger, safeguarding, and children lacking online responsibility. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of shifting guidance from stranger danger to discussing the wider SNS risks, as well as the benefits; it is crucial for greater financial investment and policy to overcome barriers to e-safety education. © 2021 The Authors.

To achieve this, an integrated and expanded user acceptance model is introduced to explain the factors affecting behavioral intention to use APTS. A total of 316 surveys were conducted from 275 participants online and 41 participants by face-to-face interviews. With data acquired from public transportation (PT) users in Istanbul, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model is modified and performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, trust and safety, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and behavioral intention constructs are utilized in the model. Age, gender, and frequency of PT usage are included in the model to examine the moderating effect on the constructs while the model is tested with structural equation modeling (SEM). The proposed model explains 72% of the variances in this study, which proves that the model has stronger predictive power compared with the previous technology acceptance model (TAM) and UTAUT model. Performance expectancy, social influence, habit, and trust and safety constructs are concluded to have significant positive effects on behavioral intention. Public usage and acceptance are necessary for the complete utilization of APTS.

This article proposes a reading of the scholarly literature concerned with the social implications of this transformation. First, we discuss the rise of a new occupational class, which we call the coding elite. This group has consolidated power through their technical control over the digital means of production and by extracting labor from a newly marginalized or unpaid workforce, the cybertariat. Second, we show that the implementation of techniques of mathematical optimization across domains as varied as education, medicine, credit and finance, and criminal justice has intensified the dominance of actuarial logics of decision-making, potentially transforming pathways to social reproduction and mobility but also generating a pushback by those so governed. Third, we explore how the same pervasive algorithmic intermediation in digital communication is transforming the way people interact, associate, and think. We conclude by cautioning against the wildest promises of artificial intelligence but acknowledging the increasingly tight coupling between algorithmic processes, social structures, and subjectivities. © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc..

However, repetitive data labelling and model training are required for every image set with the supervised techniques. In view of the large scale of IC image set being analysed, techniques that require less human intervention are desired. In this paper, we propose a template-based Tanimoto Convolution and Morphological Decision (TCMD) model for transistor interconnection retrieval in delayered ICs, that is, poly line segmentation, with minimal human intervention. In our proposed TCMD model, prior domain knowledge on the IC images is incorporated into the proposed Tanimoto convolution for generating input feature maps, eliminating the need of filter learning. We further propose morphological decision to process the input feature maps for higher accuracy and robustness on determining poly line positions. With experiments on a delayered IC @90 nm process, our proposed TCMD model achieves 3%?6% higher accuracy than the reported template-based techniques. Our proposed TCMD model also achieves competitive accuracy with the reported deep U-net while requiring 13× shorter training/validation time. To further improve the pixel-wise precision of the retrieved poly lines, which is important for applications such as analog circuit analysis, we propose a deep learning-based TCMD-PL model. The proposed TCMD-PL model utilises the output of TCMD model as the pseudo labels for training a deep convolutional neural network in supervised manner, and it is able to achieve further performance improvement of ?4% in comparison to TCMD model without extra data labelling. © 2021 The Authors.

Analyzing roughly 250,000 tweets collected in the first 10 years of Aadhaar’s operation, we find that both normative acceptance and cost–benefit calculations are crucial for legitimacy attribution. This finding challenges mainstream theoretical approaches, which prioritize normative factors and often fail to examine how normative and material factors interact during legitimacy attribution. In addition, our study demonstrates a new, mixed-methods approach to measuring legitimacy attribution using Twitter data, which overcomes traditional challenges.

Hence, there is an increasing research interest in automatic age estimation using biometric traits such as face and gait. In recent years, gait analysis has received growing attention due to the pervasive nature of video surveillance. Gait signals that measure the manner of walking can be obtained using vision and sensor-based techniques. Individual gait patterns obtainable from videos, images, or sensors are shown unconsciously and are not easily obscured. Additionally, gait signals can be obtained unobtrusively with cameras placed at a long distance because gait does not require high-resolution images. However, the extraction of age-associated gait features is a challenging task due to various gait covariates. These covariates include clothing and view changes for vision-based gait; walking slope and footwear for sensor-based gait. This paper provides a survey of scientific literature on age estimation using gait features. We focus on the approaches to extracting age-associated gait features, namely, vision-based and sensor-based approaches, how they may be affected by the different covariates, and domain-specific applications. To make this work useful for as wide of an audience as possible, we also include discussions on key topics such as existing datasets, evaluation strategies, and open challenges that should be addressed in the future. © 2013 IEEE.",Age estimation; Age group classification; Gait; Gait age; Gait feature extraction,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111095142

The knowledge management system (KMS) application calls for providing several benefits to lecturers and students, producing daily information, documenting records for evidence of a transaction, and eventually improving the decision-making process. Knowledge management can be coupled with fuzzy logic to deal with imprecision and uncertainty of data in a KMS. The ICT dynamic development has shifted the HLI operations from manual to electronic-based handling of related information. KMS is one of the systems that are of significant consideration in this regard. Nevertheless, such a system has not been extensively adopted as expected due to users' rejection of its use. In the present paper, the factors affecting the decision to adopt/reject KMS are highlighted. The study is qualitative and entails a critical review of the related literature concerning the topic, backed by interviews. KMS experts working with highly reputable HLI were interviewed. A total of 11 factors were focused on in light of their effect on the decision to adopt/reject KMS, as argued by the technological adoption theories and literature review.

This closed-design paradigm has limited the capability of the switches to proprietary implementations which are hard-coded by vendors, inducing a lengthy, costly, and inflexible process. Recently, data plane programmability has attracted significant attention from both the research community and the industry, permitting operators and programmers in general to run customized packet processing functions. This open-design paradigm is paving the way for an unprecedented wave of innovation and experimentation by reducing the time of designing, testing, and adopting new protocols; enabling a customized, top-down approach to develop network applications; providing granular visibility of packet events defined by the programmer; reducing complexity and enhancing resource utilization of the programmable switches; and drastically improving the performance of applications that are offloaded to the data plane. Despite the impressive advantages of programmable data plane switches and their importance in modern networks, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey.

This study proposes a novel approach for multi-criteria decision-making problems using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with the trapezoidal neutrosophic fuzzy numbers to produce the best criteria for evaluating total transportation cost. The proposed trapezoidal neutrosophic fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (TNF-AHP) determines the most significant criteria to be considered for further investigation in ANN training. In this study on the transportation problem (TP), the demands at different destination points and the distances between source and demand cities were determined. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been proposed for the collected data of the TP to investigate the prediction of total transportation cost. The proposed ANN model predicts the total transportation cost with two input which were chosen by the TNF-AHP. Collected data are trained from 2 to 25 neurons with a logsig activation function, and the ideal model for ANN has been observed by Levenberg-Marquardt's feed-forward back-propagation (trainlm) learning algorithm with a single hidden layer (6-9-1) topology. It is found that the ANN model can predict the total transportation cost with high efficiency as the R values indicate a high degree of correlation. The recommended ANN model, mean absolute percentage error, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (R), and mean square error have been obtained adequately. The ANN model validation has been conducted, and its results are compared with the collected data. © 2013 IEEE.",Analytical hierarchy process; artificial neural network; feed forward back propagation learning algorithm; transportation problem; trapezoidal neutrosophic fuzzy number,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111013904

Despite the fact that many studies have been conducted with a focus on technology standards, the ways in which primary actors of standards affect the market are yet to be fully investigated in extant studies. In this study, we investigate the primary actors in technology standardization by carrying out a systematic review and constructing a conceptual framework and concept maps of primary actors. Based on our analysis, we categorize primary actors, according to their roles and timing of engagement in standardization, as follows: Technology producers, standard-setters, regulators, and technology users. We illustrate each actor's detailed actions, motives, and difficulties with concept maps that are structured based on the SAO/P model, in order to elucidate why primary actors participate in standardization and how they act to achieve their goals or resolve difficulties. Based on our findings, we derive implications in terms of the strategic management of standardization activities in the manufacturing industry. © 2013 IEEE.",competitive strategy; concept map; standardization; technology management; Technology standards,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110818111

They support researchers to find research collaborators automatically. The main challenge of current expert finding systems is that they retrieve experts based on the content of their documents but ignore the human interaction perspective. The human interaction perspective comprises the factors that influence collaborator selection decisions in real life. This study aimed to develop a collaborator selection model for expert finding systems in research universities. This model includes human capital, social capital, and cultural capital factors that influence collaborator selection. The researchers integrated the Scientific and Technical Human Capital (STHC) model and Social Capital Theory to determine these factors. The authors conducted a survey comprising 349 researchers from Malaysian research universities to validate the research hypotheses. A partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze all the survey data. The empirical results revealed that the significant factors that influence collaborator selection in the research universities context were cognitive accessibility, reliability, relevance, commitment, physical accessibility, cultural experiences, complementary skills, and research experience. Surprisingly, the results revealed that network ties, relational accessibility, and reputation were insignificant factors for collaborator selection. This study proposed a research model for collaborator selection in the research universities context and provided several recommendations for the policymakers and practitioners. The model will help to provide sufficient criteria to select academic research collaborator in universities and can be used by expert finding systems designers, researchers, collaborators, and universities. © 2013 IEEE.",collaborator selection; Expert finding systems; research collaboration; scientific and technical human capital; social capital,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110817538

Existing IDSs based on shallow and deep network architectures demand high computational resources and high volumes of data to establish an adaptive detection engine that discovers new families of attacks from the edge of IoT networks. However, attackers exploit network gateways at the edge using new attacking scenarios (i.e., zero-day attacks), such as ransomware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper proposes new IDS based on Few-Shot Deep Learning, named CNN-IDS, which can automatically identify zero-day attacks from the edge of a network and protect its IoT systems. The proposed system comprises two-methodological stages: 1) a filtered Information Gain method is to select themost useful features fromnetwork data, and 2) one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is to recognize new attack types from a network s edge. The proposed model is trained and validated using two datasets of theUNSW-NB15 and Bot-IoT. The experimental results showed that it enhances about a 3% detection rate and around a 3% 4% falsepositive rate with the UNSW-NB15 dataset and about an 8% detection rate using the BoT-IoT dataset. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The research portrays an integrated research model involving factors that impact behavioral intention and use behavior of s-commerce consumers whilst synthesizing prior empirical findings. A meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) method was used to synthesize 189 findings reported in 68 s-commerce studies and to analyze the structural model. Our findings show that trust and informational support have positive effects on behavioral intention while trust and emotional support have positive effects on use behavior. Furthermore, our findings highlight that behavioral intention influences use behavior and mediates the effect of trust and informational support on use behavior.

Women buyer market for financial products is an untapped yet promising segment, however, beyond certain generic assumptions, very little is known about the consumer behavior patterns, satisfaction, and positive word of mouth (WOM) of women customers related to financial products. Targeting a serving woman as a financial service customer necessitates an understanding of the factors contributing to satisfaction level leading to the positive WOM of female customers. Therefore, this paper is an effort to explore the role of the responsiveness component of service quality and sincerity dimension of brand personality on WOM via customer satisfaction. Using the partial least square method in structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) on 183 working women respondents in India, the research results highlighted some interesting findings. Results revealed that brand sincerity directly impacts the WOM of the women customers where achieving satisfaction is not necessary; however, the responsiveness of a financial product does not directly lead to a positive WOM, rather through satisfaction. The research is novel in empirically testing and comparing the role of brand sincerity and responsiveness in generating satisfaction and positive WOM.

Traditionally, many developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America remain marginal participants in the global flow of biodata, which will eventually affect their productivity and economies. Here, we present the Ecuadorian Microbiome Project (EcuMP) as an integrative initiative to close the research gap in the microbiome for Ecuador. We discuss the relevance that the study of the microbiome has for our understanding of diversity and new forms of production and biocapital. We also evaluate the state of research in metagenomics and the microbiome for South America, with emphasis on Ecuador as a small but biodiverse country. In the strict sense of access, understanding, and technological innovation based on molecular data, we propose the definition of bioliteracy. As indirect estimates of bioliteracy, we measured the number of indexed publications, BioProjects, monthly global internet traffic to GenBank, and patent applications in Espacenet. South America has a notable unevenness in scientific productivity related to the microbiome and metagenomics. Brazil leads productivity, with most of the measured parameters remaining one order of magnitude higher than other countries in the region. Participation of South American countries in the global flow of genomic information dwarfs when compared to the US. To reduce the effects of technological dependency and the associated lack of economic productivity, Ecuador should address the technological gap in the study of the microbiome.

However, no existing collaborative approach has been able to cater for multiple regulators, divergent incident views and incident reputation trust issues that national cybersecurity incident management presents. This paper aims to propose a collaborative approach to handle these issues cost-effectively. Design/methodology/approach: A collaborative-based national cybersecurity incident management architecture based on ITU-T X.1056 security incident management framework is proposed. It is composed of the cooperative regulatory unit with cooperative and third-party management strategies and an execution unit, with incident handling and response strategies. Novel collaborative incident prioritization and mitigation planning models that are fit for incident handling in national cybersecurity incident management are proposed. Findings: Use case depicting how the collaborative-based national cybersecurity incident management would function within a typical information and communication technology ecosystem is illustrated. The proposed collaborative approach is evaluated based on the performances of an experimental cyber-incident management system against two multistage attack scenarios. The results show that the proposed approach is more reliable compared to the existing ones based on descriptive statistics. Originality/value: The approach produces better incident impact scores and rankings than standard tools. The approach reduces the total response costs by 8.33% and false positive rate by 97.20% for the first attack scenario, while it reduces the total response costs by 26.67% and false positive rate by 78.83% for the second attack scenario. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Collaborative approach; Incident handling and response; Incident management; Information security; Information security management; National cybersecurity,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108835293

However, limited attention has been paid to the use of social media in improving the design of public policies. This paper explores to what extent citizens’ opinions and responses expressed on social media platforms contribute to policy design. The paper analyzes discussion about the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ scheme on Twitter through social media analytics techniques such as content analytics and then traces the change in policy design over two years. To validate findings from Twitter data, and assess the evolution in policy design, we conducted in-depth interviews with experts and extensive document analysis. The paper reveals that consistently similar issues were raised by experts in the past as well as by citizens in the current scheme. However, over time policy design has not changed significantly. Therefore, despite a strong social media presence, its optimum use to improve policy effectiveness is yet to be achieved. The paper contributes by exploring the role social media can play in the public policy process and policy design in developing countries’ contexts and identifies gaps in existing social media strategies of public agencies. © 2021. authors.",Policy Co-Design; Policy Responsiveness; Public Policy; Social Media; Twitter Analytics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108804388

The security community has demonstrated that without transparency of the data and the resulting model, there exist many potential security risks, with new risks constantly being discovered. In this paper, we focus on one of these security risks - poisoning attacks. Specifically, we analyze how attackers may interfere with the results of regression learning by poisoning the training datasets. To this end, we analyze and develop a new poisoning attack algorithm. Our attack, termed Nopt, in contrast with previous poisoning attack algorithms, can produce larger errors with the same proportion of poisoning data-points. Furthermore, we also significantly improve the state-of-the-art defense algorithm, termed TRIM, proposed by Jagielsk et al. (IEEE SP 2018), by incorporating the concept of probability estimation of clean data-points into the algorithm. Our new defense algorithm, termed Proda, demonstrates an increased effectiveness in reducing errors arising from the poisoning dataset through optimizing ensemble models. We highlight that the time complexity of TRIM had not been estimated; however, we deduce from their work that TRIM can take exponential time complexity in the worst-case scenario, in excess of Proda's logarithmic time. The performance of both our proposed attack and defense algorithms is extensively evaluated on four real-world datasets of housing prices, loans, health care, and bike sharing services. We hope that our work will inspire future research to develop more robust learning algorithms immune to poisoning attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Complexity; Data poisoning attacks and defenses; Linear regression models,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108712853

It has led to preventive measures such as physical distancing to be imposed on individuals and led to terms such as ‘lockdown,’ ‘emergency,’ or curfew’ to emerge in various countries. It has affected society, not only physically and financially, but in terms of emotional wellbeing as well. This distress in the human emotional quotient results from multiple factors such as financial implications, family member’s behavior and support, country-specific lockdown protocols, media influence, or fear of the pandemic. For efficient pandemic management, there is a need to understand the emotional variations among individuals, as this will provide insights into public sentiment towards various government pandemic management policies. From our investigations, it was found that individuals have increasingly used different microblogging platforms such as Twitter to remain connected and express their feelings and concerns during the pandemic. However, research in the area of expressed emotional wellbeing during COVID 19 is still growing, which motivated this team to form the aim: To identify, explore and understand globally the emotions expressed during the earlier months of the pandemic COVID 19 by utilizing Deep Learning and Natural language Processing (NLP). For the data collection, over 2 million tweets during February–June 2020 were collected and analyzed using an advanced deep learning technique of Transfer Learning and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). A Reddit-based standard Emotion Dataset by Crowdflower was utilized for transfer learning. Using RoBERTa and the collated Twitter dataset, a multi-class emotion classifier system was formed. With the implemented methodology, a tweet classification accuracy of 80.33% and an average MCC score of 0.78 was achieved, improving the existing AI-based emotion classification methods. This study explains the novel application of the Roberta model during the pandemic that provided insights into changing emotional wellbeing over time of various citizens worldwide. It also offers novelty for data mining and analytics during this challenging, pandemic era. These insights can be beneficial for formulating effective pandemic management strategies and devising a novel, predictive strategy for the emotional well-being of an entire country’s citizens when facing future unexpected exogenous shocks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",COVID’19; Deep learning; Emotion analysis; RoBERTa; Transfer learning; Twitter,Article,Article in Press,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108516378

The Business Intelligence System (BIS) is one of the emphasized innovations, and due to its potential to provide more intellectual information for decision-making processes, has attracted the interest of industry analysts and policymakers. Literature suggests that the BIS is integrated by organizations in different sectors, but most BIS initiatives struggle to produce the anticipated outcomes. Moreover, the adoption of BIS in SMEs generally and healthcare specifically is rather insignificant. This is due to numerous factors. It is therefore necessary to discover and analyze the essential determinants affecting the adoption of BIS in healthcare SMEs. Therefore, this study tries to tackle this gap by exploring the relevant factors for BIS adoption using a systematic literature review (SLR) and an expert-ranking survey of 63 studies that were published in Scopus and WoS databases from 2011 to 2020. A total of 22 determinants are identified and sent to 15 experts. The data that were gathered from these experts were analyzed using SPSS. The results of the analysis indicated 15 determinants were significant, and one determinant was added by an expert. Consequently, a theoretical structure has been developed based on technology, organization, environment, and CEOs determinants and theories. The results of the current study will deepen the current BIS literature and advance the understanding of the significant elements of BIS adoption decision. © 2021 The Author(s).

Relevant data-driven methodologies are typically concentrated on the scoring systems of CVE prioritization schemes, the scoring formulas of CVSS metrics, and other vulnerability impact factors. However, these prioritized lists such as the CWE/SANS Top 25 suffer from a critical weakness: they fail to consider empirical evidence of exploits. Considering the distinct properties and specific risks of SCADA systems in IIoT, this paper overcomes the inherent limitation of IIoT empirical research which is the sample size of exploits by collecting data manually. This study then developed an exploits factors-embedded regression model to statistically access the significant relationships between security, privacy, and trust-based vulnerability attributes. Through this data-driven empirical methodology, the study elucidated the interactions of security, privacy, and trust in IIoT with professional quantitative indicators, which would provide grounds for substantial further related work. In addition to the security privacy and trust regression analysis, this study further explores the impact of IoT and IIoT by difference-in-difference (DID) approach, applying bootstrap standard error with Kernel option and quantile DID test to evaluate the robustness of DID model. In general, the empirical results indicated that: 1) the CVSS score of vulnerability is irrelevant to the disclosure of exploits, but is positively correlated with CWEs by Density and CVE year, 2) among the exploits of SCADA-related authors, the more identical CWEs that exist in these exploits, the higher the CVSS score of the exploit CVE will be, and CVE year has a negative moderating effect within this relationship; 3) the CVSS scores of SCADA exploits have significantly decreased in comparison with non-SCADA after the promulgation of Industry 4.0. © 2021, Strojarski Facultet.

This research aimed to explore the factors affecting the adoption of AR technology in the retail sector through an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM). The conceptual model was developed based on additional open-innovation-related constructs to the existing TAM constructs. To test the model, data were collected from 233 retail stores in Malaysia using a structured questionnaire survey. The PLS-based structural equation modeling technique was used to analyze the data. The empirical results confirmed that, except for external support and trading partner pressure, other factors, including perceived usefulness, attitude, competitive pressure, customer pressure, perceived cost, and technological knowledge have significant influences on the intention to use AR technology in retail stores. The attitude mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention and the relationship between self-efficacy and behavioral intention. As operating cost was a critical factor, managers are advised to deliver various packages of after-sales services and free installation charges to curb expenses.

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy. We conclude by identifying the European Union as being especially well-placed to play a leading role in this policy response and provide 13 recommendations that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing its impact on the environment. © 2021, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Digital ethics; Digital governance; Environment; Sustainability,Article,Article in Press,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107444145

The survey will be useful to faculty members, students, and management to adopt new tools and mindsets for positive outcomes. This work reports on implementing and assessing blended learning at two different universities (University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, India, and Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India). The assessments prepare the benefits and challenges of learning (by students) and teaching (by faculty) blended learning courses with different online learning tools. Additionally, student performance in the traditional and blended learning courses was compared to list the concerns about effectively shifting the face-to-face courses to a blended learning model in emergencies like COVID-19. As a result, it has been observed that blended learning is helpful for school, university, and professional training. A large set of online and e-learning platforms are developed in recent times that can be used in blended learning to improve the learner's abilities.

Hence, it is often more desired to let users choose their own best from a set of diverse and adjustable enhanced images with astounding quality. However, a system that can satisfy this requirement has not yet been established. While classical algorithms blindly enhance an image by filtering, recent intelligent enhancement systems can only do it with limited styles through learning from a set of single expert-retouched (ER) images. To fill this void, we propose a novel framework, Diverse and adjustable Versatile Image Enhancer (DaVIE), that learns from multiple ER images simultaneously. Thereby, it can output diverse results without being bound to a specific enhancement style while allowing users to freely adjust the level of enhancement. For ease of diversity, we adopt a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that learns stochastic distribution of enhancement styles. By using the VAE, the proposed model provides diversely enhanced images. To establish better control in terms of enhancement level, we propose a more general form of adaptive instance normalization and loss functions, which can afford even extreme image editing. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DaVIE framework yields visually pleasing and diverse results. We also show the proposed model quantitatively outperforms existing methods on the MIT-Adobe-5K dataset. Furthermore, through a strict user-study, we show that the users consider the qualities of ER images and machine-retouched images to be similar, with about 35% selection probability for DaVIE enhanced images. © 2013 IEEE.",adaptive-instance normalization; adjustable learning; automatic photo enhancement; Diverse image enhancement; variational autoencoder,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107235970

Careful planning for and accommodation of accelerating urbanization and citizenization (i.e., migrants gaining official urban residency) may be the best approach to limit some of the worst impacts. However, we find that another trajectory may be possible: one linked to the rural development plan adopted in the latest Chinese national development strategy. This plan aims to build rural areas as attractive areas for settlement by 2050 rather than to further urbanize with more people in cities. We assess the political motivations and challenges behind this choice to develop rural areas based on a literature review and empirical case analysis. After assessing the rural and urban policy subsystem, we find five socio-political drivers behind China’s rural development strategy, namely ensuring food security, promoting culture and heritage, addressing overcapacity, emphasizing environmental protection and eradicating poverty. To develop rural areas, China needs to effectively resolve three dilemmas: (1) implementing decentralized policies under central supervision; (2) deploying limited resources efficiently to achieve targets; and (3) addressing competing narratives in current policies. Involving more rural community voices, adopting multiple forms of local governance, and identifying and mitigating negative project impacts can be the starting points to manage these dilemmas. © 2021 by the authors.

It helps to properly allocate vehicles, ease the traffic pressure and improve passengers’ experience. Traditional taxi demand prediction methods mostly rely on time-series forecasting techniques, which cannot model the nonlinearity embedded in data. Recent studies start to combine the Euclidean spatial features through grid-based methods. By considering the spatial correlations among different regions, we can capture how the temporal events have impacts on those with adjacent links or intersections and improve prediction precision. Some graph-based models are proposed to encode the non-Euclidean correlations as well. However, the temporal periodicity of data is often overlooked, and the study units are usually constructed as oversimplified grids. In this paper, we define places with specific semantic and humanistic experiences as study units, using a fuzzy set method based on adaptive kernel density estimation. Then, we introduce dual temporal gated multi-graph convolution network to predict the future taxi demand. Specifically, multi-graph convolution is used to model spatial correlations with graphs, including the neighborhood, functional similarities and landscape similarities based on street view images. As for the temporal dependencies modeling, we design the dual temporal gated branches to capture information hidden in both previous and periodic observations.

It is argued that overly focusing on the latest high-tech weapons risks a type of naïve technological determinism and obscures how high- and low-tech weapons are often complementary. It is this synergy that requires greater understanding and attention. Moreover, relatively low-tech weapons like guns could be surprisingly relevant in the context of hybrid and amphibious warfare scenarios involving China and the USA, especially for the diplomacy of the “shot across the bows”. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",amphibious operations; maritime hybrid warfare; naval guns; naval warfare; Sino-American rivalry; technology,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106266232

In this paper, we propose a novel incremental algorithmic framework for arbitrary-order reachability computation in massive graphs. The proposed method is intuitive and significantly outperforms the currently known methods in terms of computation time. We focus on the arbitrary-order reachability matrix framework called AORM, which can handle directed and disconnected networks such as citation networks. The AORM can handle diverse types of real-world datasets. We conduct extensive experimental studies with twenty synthetic networks generated from five random graph generation models and twenty massive real-world networks. The experimental results show the advantages of the method in terms of both computational efficiency and approximation controllability. In particular, the proposed method outperforms up to 10 times compared to NetworkX for incremental all-pairs shortest paths computation. Moreover, the computational results of the method rapidly converge to the ground truths. Thus, we can get the correct solution in the early stage of the incremental approximation. We can employ the method as a versatile feature extraction framework for network embedding. Overall, the experimental results present a remarkable improvement in speed-up for reachability computation. © 2013 IEEE.",approximate all-pairs shortest paths; graph embedding; graph girth; higher-order structural proximity; Reachability query,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106033078

All nine nuclear-armed states are engaged in nuclear weapons development and modernization aiming at diversity, precision, rapid mobilization and survivability, thereby increasing the probability of swift crisis escalation between nuclear-armed adversaries endangering the security of entire international community. Amid this weapons development and modernization, lack of and weak lines of communication between nuclear-armed adversaries during crises is crucial to work on as this could bring the world perilously close to sailing directly into the headwinds of nuclear war. The importance of building and maintaining communication between nuclear-armed states during crises is indisputable. Hence, building an information flow via a backup hotline among supreme nuclear commanders based on agreed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for its operation could serve to reduce nuclear risk should it ever be needed. This hotline will socialize nuclear commanders and national leaders to be ready to: 1) disentangle communication during crises from domestic political pressures by practicing agreed SOPs of hotline before a crisis occurs, 2) build confidence among nuclear-armed states–and the international system in general–that the means to control escalation exists, even if the political will is lagging, and 3) open opportunities for nuclear-armed states to broaden their discussion from the specifics of a nuclear hotline to the need to develop new norms that cover the entire nuclear command-and- control system. © 2021 The Author(s).

One primary research focus area is the identification of bio-markers that not only identify stress but also predict the conditions (or tasks) that cause stress. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been used for a long time to study and identify bio-markers. While these bio-markers have successfully predicted stress in EEG studies for binary conditions, their performance is suboptimal for multiple conditions of stress. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we propose using latent based representations of the bio-markers, which have been shown to significantly improve EEG performance compared to traditional bio-markers alone. We evaluated three commonly used EEG based bio-markers for stress, the brain load index (BLI), the spectral power values of EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta and theta), and the relative gamma (RG), with their respective latent representations using four commonly used classifiers. Results: The results show that spectral power value based bio-markers had a high performance with an accuracy of 83%, while the respective latent representations had an accuracy of 91%. © 2013 IEEE.",Autoencoder; electroencephalogram; stress classification; support vector machine,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105886587

To cope with energy demands, electrical networks emphasize the efficient utilization of power transmission. Thus, high-voltage DC (HVDC) and hybrid (AC/DC) transmission systems are also getting attention owing to their high efficiency in addition to the widely adopted high-voltage AC (HVAC) systems. Most faults in the bulk of transmission lines are temporary or intermittent. Auto-reclosing schemes can be used to prevent these faults. However, conventional auto-reclosing schemes based on constant dead time cannot recognize the fault nature within the assigned duration. Consequently, the accuracy of power grids can be compromised. Therefore, adaptive auto-reclosing schemes are convenient for overcoming the issues caused by the rapid restoration of faulty power lines. This can enhance system reliability and avoid power failures and blackouts. This study is based on a systematic, detailed, and thorough research review of the existing auto-reclosing schemes in all three power transmission lines, i.e., AC, DC, and hybrid (AC/DC). Subsequently, a critical analysis has been performed to assess the pros and cons of each existing adaptive auto-reclosing scheme.

Our system facilitates autonomous data collection from mobile app logs and Google app servers and generates a high-dimensional dataset that can detect outlier behaviors. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithmwas applied for effective singular movement analysis. To analyze high-level mobile phone usage, the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm was employed. These two clustering algorithms can effectively detect outlier behaviors in terms of movement and app usage in indoor spaces. The experimental results showed that our system enables effective spatial behavioral analysis at a low cost when applied to logs collected in actual living spaces.

We hypothesize that ensemble modeling of wildfire susceptibility is better than a single modeling technique. This study models the occurrence of wildfire in the Brisbane Catchment of Australia, which is an annual event, using the index of entropy (IoE), evidential belief function (EBF), and logistic regression (LR) ensemble techniques. As a secondary goal of this research, the spatial distribution of the wildfire risk from different aspects such as urbanization and ecosystem was evaluated. The highest accuracy (88.51%) was achieved using the ensemble EBF and LR model.

Multipath is a broader term, but in the context of this survey, we define multipath as enhancing network routing technique by using various paths that are not necessarily completely disjoint. Multipath can furnish a variety of advantages such as reliability,connection persistence, increased perceived throughput and load balancing. On the other hand, multihoming is the ability to use multiple network interfaces when connecting to the Internet to increase reliability, resilience, and performance. Most existing surveys are specialized in one specific domain area related to multipath or multihoming. This study covers the research proposals at the different layers/sublayers of an overlay network from transport to the application and extends to cover the latest technologies like machine learning, Fog and Mobile Edge computing, VR 360 video, and the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). As such, our work tries to be as comprehensive as possible to relate multipath and multihoming research solutions for video streaming to the current and emerging video streaming technologies. © 2013 IEEE.",fog computing; Internet of Multimedia Things; mobile edge computing; multihoming; multipath; VR 360 video,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105077216

The existing POI recommendation systems require raw check-in history of users, which might cause location privacy violations. Although there have been several matrix factorization (MF) based privacy-preserving recommendation systems, they can only focus on user-POI relationships without considering the human movements in check-in history. To tackle this problem, we design a successive POI recommendation framework with local differential privacy, named SPIREL. SPIREL uses two types of information derived from the check-in history as input for the factorization: a transition pattern between two POIs and the visit counts of POIs. We propose a novel objective function for learning the user-POI and POI-POI relationships simultaneously. We further integrate local differential privacy mechanisms in our proposed framework to prevent potential location privacy breaches. Experiments using four public datasets demonstrate that SPIREL achieves better POI recommendation quality while accomplishing stronger privacy preservation. © 2013 IEEE.",local differential privacy; matrix factorization; Point-of-Interest; recommendation system,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105029928

The results show that the overall distribution of cultural relics exhibits the characteristics of class aggregation, dynasty aggregation and regional aggregation. From the perspective of a time scale, cultural relics have different “life cycles”, displaying continuity, intermittentness, and similarity. From the perspective of a spatial scale, the cultural relic distribution forms a small “cultural communication circle”, showing aggregation, migration, and similarity.

Machine learning algorithms are promising methods for drought prediction as they require less time, minimal inputs, and are relatively less complex than dynamic or physical models. In this study, a combination of machine learning with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is proposed for analysis of drought within a representative case study in the Tibetan Plateau, China, for the period of 1980-2019. Two timescales of 3 months (SPEI-3) and 6 months (SPEI-6) aggregation were considered. Four machine learning models of Random Forest (RF), the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), the Convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Long-term short memory (LSTM) were developed for the estimation of the SPEIs. Seven scenarios of various combinations of climate variables as input were adopted to build the models. The best models were XGB with scenario 5 (precipitation, average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed and relative humidity) and RF with scenario 6 (precipitation, average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and sunshine) for estimating SPEI-3. LSTM with scenario 4 (precipitation, average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed) was relatively better for SPEI-6 estimation. The best model for SPEI-6 was XGB with scenario 5 and RF with scenario 7 (all input climate variables, i.e., scenario 6 + solar radiation). Based on the NSE index, the performances of XGB and RF models are classified as good fits for scenarios 4 to 7 for both timescales. The developed models produced satisfactory results and they could be used as a rapid tool for decision making by water-managers. © 2013 IEEE.",Drought events; Extreme Gradient Boost; machine learning; SPEI; Tibetan Plateau,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104659257

A cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising framework for next-generation cellular communication, which can satisfy the requirements of significantly increasing data traffic and user demands. In C-RAN, the data processing unit can be centralized and virtualized in data centers and can be shared among distributed base stations. Deep learning (DL) appears to be a feasible approach for facilitating the data processing capability, resource management in the cloud, and predicting dynamic traffic in cellular communication. The convergence of C-RAN and DL is expected to bring new prospects to both interdisciplinary research and industrial applications. In this regard, different approaches have been proposed for DL-based C-RAN in the literature. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art DL techniques applied in C-RAN. A brief introduction of the C-RAN architecture and DL techniques is given to provide insights into these two emerging technologies. Existing surveys are also discussed to highlight the research gap. The reviewed works are categorized into power consumption optimization, network performance maximization, and QoS maximization based on their optimization objectives.

Crop yield predictions are carried out to estimate higher crop yield through the use of machine learning algorithms which are one of the challenging issues in the agricultural sector. Due to this developing significance of crop yield prediction, this article provides an exhaustive review on the use of machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield with special emphasis on palm oil yield prediction. Initially, the current status of palm oil yield around the world is presented, along with a brief discussion on the overview of widely used features and prediction algorithms. Then, the critical evaluation of the state-of-the-art machine learning-based crop yield prediction, machine learning application in the palm oil industry and comparative analysis of related studies are presented. Consequently, a detailed study of the advantages and difficulties related to machine learning-based crop yield prediction and proper identification of current and future challenges to the agricultural industry is presented. The potential solutions are additionally prescribed in order to alleviate existing problems in crop yield prediction. Since one of the major objectives of this study is to explore the future perspectives of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction, the areas including application of remote sensing, plant's growth and disease recognition, mapping and tree counting, optimum features and algorithms have been broadly discussed. Finally, a prospective architecture of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction has been proposed based on the critical evaluation of existing related studies.

We have proposed a novel technique based on the alpha-beta filter and deep extreme learning machine (DELM) algorithm named as learning to alpha-beta filter. The proposed method has two main components, namely the prediction unit and the learning unit. We have used the alpha-beta filter in the prediction unit, and the learning unit uses a DELM. The main problem with the conventional alpha-beta filter is that the values are generally selected via the trial-and-error technique. Once the alpha-beta values are chosen for a specific problem, they remain fixed for the entire data. It has been observed that different alpha-beta values for the same problem give different results. Hence it is essential to tune the alpha-beta values according to their historical behavior for certain values. Therefore, in the proposed method, we have addressed this problem and added the learning module to the conventional ? - ? filter to improve the ? - ? filter's performance. The DELM algorithm has been used to enhance the conventional alpha-beta filter algorithm's performance in dynamically changing conditions. The model performance has been measured using indoor environmental values of temperature and humidity. The relative improvement in the proposed learning prediction model's accuracy was 7.72% and 16.47% in RMSE and MSE metrics. The results show that the proposed model outperforms in terms of the result as compared to the conventional alpha-beta filter. © 2013 IEEE.",Alpha-beta filter; deep extreme learning machine; energy prediction; learning algorithm; prediction algorithm,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104588158

The artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is generally used for stochastic forecasting rainfall which is not capable to simulate unseen extreme rainfall events which become common due to climate change. A new model is developed in this study for prediction of daily rainfall for different lead times based on sea level pressure (SLP) which is physically related to rainfall on land and thus able to predict unseen rainfall events. Daily rainfall of east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (PM) was predicted using SLP data over the climate domain. Five advanced AI algorithms such as extreme learning machine (ELM), Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNNs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), extreme gradient boosting (xgBoost), and hybrid neural fuzzy inference system (HNFIS) were used considering the complex relationship of rainfall with sea level pressure. Principle components of SLP domain correlated with daily rainfall were used as predictors. The results revealed that the efficacy of AI models is predicting daily rainfall one day before. The relative performance of the models revealed the higher performance of BRNN with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.678 compared with HNFIS (NRMSE = 0.708), BART (NRMSE = 0.784), xgBoost (NRMSE = 0.803), and ELM (NRMSE = 0.915). Visual inspection of predicted rainfall during model validation using densityscatter plot and other novel ways of visual comparison revealed the ability of BRNN to predict daily rainfall one day before reliably.

This study examined Alzheimer's patients living in South Korea to understand the predictors of anxiety using boosting algorithms (i.e., AdaBoost and XGBoost) and data-level approach (raw data, undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE) and confirmed the machine learning algorithm with the best prediction performance.

This study developed models for predicting the anxiety of Alzheimer's dementia patients using AdaBoost and XGBoost. Moreover, this study compared the prediction performance (i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of the models. The results of this study showed that XGBoost based on SMOTE (accuracy=0.84, sensitivity=0.85, and specificity=0.81) was identified as the model with the best prediction performance.

Furthermore, the impact of climate change on the mean wind power (under the representative concentration pathway 8.5, RCP8.5, scenario) is found to be less than 5%, which indicates the sustainability of wind renewable energy.

Then, an investigation has been conducted and reported based on the state-of-the-art human detection descriptors (e.g. Log-Average Miss Rate and accuracy). Although techniques such as Viola-Jones and Speeded-Up Robust Features can detect objects in real-time and overcome Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) limitations, they are still sensitive to illuminated conditions. Other techniques such as SIFT, Bag of Words, Orthogonal Moments, and Histogram of oriented Gradients provide other interesting benefits which include insensitivity to occlusion and clutters, simplicity, low-order element construction and invariance to illuminated conditions; nevertheless, they are computationally expensive and sensitive to image rotation. A meticulous review along similar lines revealed that the Deformable Part-based Model performs relatively better due to its ability to deal with particular pose variations and multiple views, occlusion handling (partial) and is application-free while its counterparts focus on only a single aspect. This article highlights and provides a brief description of each available data-sets for human detection research. Various use-cases of human detection systems are also elaborated. Finally, various conclusions are derived based on the conducted review followed by recommendations for future directions and possibilities to further improve the speed and accuracy of human detection systems. © 2013 IEEE.",classifiers; Computer vision; feature extraction techniques; human detection; object detection,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103793243

Ongoing studies on Data Fusion (DF) have produced significant improvement in ITS and manifested an enormous impact on its growth. This paper reviews the implementation of DF methods in ITS to facilitate traffic flow analysis (TFA) and solutions that entail the prediction of various traffic variables such as driving behavior, travel time, speed, density, incident, and traffic flow. It attempts to identify and discuss real-time and multi-sensor data sources that are used for various traffic domains, including road/highway management, traffic states estimation, and traffic controller optimization. Moreover, it attempts to associate abstractions of data level fusion, feature level fusion, and decision level fusion on DF methods to better understand the role of DF in TFA and ITS. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to review DF methods used for real-time and multi-sensor (heterogeneous) TFA studies. The review outcomes are (i) a guideline of constructing DF methods which involve preprocessing, filtering, decision, and evaluation as core steps, (ii) a description of the recent DF algorithms or methods that adopt real-time and multi-sensor sources data and the impact of these data sources on the improvement of TFA, (iii) an examination of the testing and evaluation methodologies and the popular datasets and (iv) an identification of several research gaps, some current challenges, and new research trends. © 2013 IEEE.",data fusion; heterogeneous data; Intelligent transportation systems; machine learning; multi-sensor; real-time processing; traffic flow analysis,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103782712

The increasing amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging technologies in IoT offer the rice smart farming strategy new abilities to predict changes and identify opportunities. The quality of data collected from sensors greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML algorithms. These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously to improve all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform traditional rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice precision agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of the latest research on intelligent data processing technology applied in agriculture, particularly in rice production. We describe the data captured and elaborate role of machine learning algorithms in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning in various scenarios, smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality of paddy rice and paddy rice sample classification. This paper also presents a framework that maps the activities defined in rice smart farming, data used in data modelling and machine learning algorithms used for each activity defined in the production and post-production phases of paddy rice. Based on the proposed mapping framework, our conclusion is that an efficient and effective integration of all these three technologies is very crucial that transform traditional rice cultivation practices into a new perspective of intelligence in rice precision agriculture.

The traditional cloud systems are unable to meet those requirements solely. In the said perspective, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) serves as a proxy between the things (devices) and the cloud, pushing the computations at the edge of the network. The MEC provides an effective solution to fulfill the demands of low-latency applications and services by executing most of the tasks within the proximity of users. The main challenge, however, is that too many simultaneous service requests created by wireless access produce severe interference, resulting in a decreased rate of data transmission. In this paper, we made an attempt to overcome the aforesaid limitation by proposing a user-centric QoS-aware multi-path service provisioning approach. A densely deployed base station MEC environment has overlapping coverage regions. We exploit such regions to distribute the service requests in a way that avoid hotspots and bottlenecks. Our approach is adaptive and can tune to different parameters based on service requirements. We performed several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach and compared it with the traditional Greedy approach. The results revealed that our approach improves the network state by 26.95% and average waiting time by 35.56% as compared to the Greedy approach. In addition, the QoS violations were also reduced by the fraction of 16. © 2013 IEEE.",high level petri nets; Internet of Things (IoT); Mobile edge computing; multi-path routing; quality of service (QoS); service provisioning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103776600

This algorithm is composed of a dictionary-based method, a language technology platform (LTP) tool, and the bidirectional encoder representations from a transformers-conditional random field (BERT-CRF) model. Significantly, the softmax output layer of the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformers (BERT) model is replaced by the conditional random field (CRF) algorithm to strengthen the contextual relationships between words and thus solve the local optimization of the preferred word label. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid-NLP method is verified on a realistic dataset.

Among the existing survey articles on Cloud and Fog, issues like scalability and time-critical requirements of the Internet of Things (IoT) are rarely focused on. The proliferation of IoT leads to energy crises too. The proposed survey is aimed to build a Resource Allocation and Service Placement (RASP) strategy that addresses these issues.

While RL meets the time-critical requirements of IoT with high scalability, EEC empowers RASP by saving cost and energy. As most of the early works are carried out using reactive policy, it paves the way to build RASP solutions using alternate policies.

Understanding strengths and challenges of these new approaches is important to inform improvements and implementation. In this review, we aimed to explore how these tools were utilized in four countries in Asia to facilitate COVID-19 preventative control measures. Methods: We conducted a pragmatic review of English-language literature and web-based information in Pubmed, MedRxiv, national and international public health institution websites and media sources between 1st January-3rd August 2020 to identify examples of big data and digital technologies to facilitate COVID-19 preventative control measures in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Results were summarized narratively by common technological themes, and examples of integration highlighted. Results: Digital tools implemented included real-time epidemiological dashboards, interactive maps of case location, mobile apps for tracing patients’ contacts and geofencing to monitor quarantine compliance. Examples of integration of tools included linkage of national health and immigration databases to identify high-risk individuals in Taiwan, and the use of multiple digital surveillance sources to map patients’ movements in South Korea. Challenges in balancing privacy and public good were identified. Conclusions: Digital technologies have facilitated and strengthened traditional public health measures for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Asia. Resolving issues around privacy concerns would improve future preparedness, implementation speed and uptake of digital measures.

The resulting formula bears the same form as that for the former, though the meanings of the symbols differ.

However, there has been limited research into or modern statistical analyses of precipitation and drought over Northeast China, one of the most important grain production regions. Therefore, a case study at three meteorological sites which represent three different climate types was explored, and we used time series analysis of monthly precipitation and the grey theory methods for annual precipitation during 1967–2017. Wavelet transformation (WT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long shortterm memory (LSTM) methods were utilized to depict the time series, and a new hybrid model wavelet-ARIMA-LSTM (W-AL) of monthly precipitation time series was developed.

This problem is addressed by the software development industry by software product line (SPL) practices that employ feature models. However, optimal feature selection based on user requirements is a challenging task. Thus, there is a requirement to resolve the challenges of software development, to increase satisfaction and maintain high product quality, for massive customer needs within limited resources. In this work, we propose a recommender system for the development team and clients to increase productivity and quality by utilizing historical information and prior experiences of similar developers and clients. The proposed system recommends features with their estimated cost concerning new software requirements, from all over the globe according to similar developers’ and clients’ needs and preferences. The system guides and facilitates the development team by suggesting a list of features, code snippets, libraries, cheat sheets of programming languages, and coding references from a cloud-based knowledge management repository. Similarly, a list of features is suggested to the client according to their needs and preferences. The experimental results revealed that the proposed recommender system is feasible and effective, providing better recommendations to developers and clients. It provides proper and reasonably well-estimated costs to perform development tasks effectively as well as increase the client’s satisfaction level. The results indicate that there is an increase in productivity, performance, and quality of products and a reduction in effort, complexity, and system failure. Therefore, our proposed system facilitates developers and clients during development by providing better recommendations in terms of solutions and anticipated costs. Thus, the increase in productivity and satisfaction level maximizes the benefits and usability of SPL in the modern era of technology. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

This study aims to find a means of analysis that relies on remote sensing techniques to demonstrate the effects of observed climate variability on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) of the Mesopotamia region, defined as a historical region located in the Middle East. This study employed the combined analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and two statistical analysis methods (Pearson Correlation Analysis, r; Coefficient of Determination, R2), which were applied using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and observed surface meteorological data from 2000 to 2018. The resulting NDVI images show five LULC classes with NDVI values varying between ?0.3 and 0.9. Furthermore, changes in the classified LULC area were compared statistically to those in NDVI values, where a positive relationship was found. Also, when the LST values and temperature are more extreme, the NDVI values were found to be smaller, suggesting a decrease in the density of vegetation cover. A negative correlation was found through Pearson correlation analysis (r = ??0.64), indicating a direct effect of increased temperatures on LULC. Indeed, this negative relationship between NDVI and LST was proven using R2 values, where a two-dimensional scatter plot analysis showed that R2 ranges from 0.54 to 0.9. Ultimately, the results obtained from this study reveal changes that may have many prominent effects in the field of LULC classification, accelerating the implications of climate change and variability factors. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The majority of the studies in the literature reviewed apply supervised learning approaches as a classification technique, and score level fusion is predominantly used as a fusion model. The review has determined however that there is a lack of comparative analysis on CMBA design in terms of combinations of biometric types (behavioural only, physiological only, or both), machine learning algorithms (unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning), and fusion models. Most of the studies evaluated a CMBA system's accuracy functionality, such as False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER). However, security, scalability and usability (user acceptance and satisfaction) are generally not addressed thoroughly even though these are key factors for system success in a real deployment. Furthermore, a CMBA system should be implemented and evaluated extensively on real data without restriction to prove that such systems are feasible. © 2013 IEEE.",Biometrics (access control); continuous authentication; machine learning algorithms; multimodal,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101753793

The integration of such resources has shown a substantial impact on DN through power loss reduction and improved network reliability. Besides this, the existing protection system has encountered coordination challenges due to the bidirectional power flow, different types and capacity of generation sources, and changes in fault levels due to network operating modes (grid-connected or islanded). Such conditions may cause the relays to malfunction and imperil the effectiveness of the existing protection scheme. Therefore, an efficient and robust protection coordination scheme is imperative to avoid network reliability and stability issues to the grid. This review paper presents a comparative analysis of various protection techniques implemented to alleviate the impact of integrated resources into DN. Moreover, a comparison of classical and modified protection approaches in terms of advantages, shortcomings, and implementation costs is presented. The prime objective of this study is to highlight the prominence of utilizing user-defined programmable relays for modern DNs. Moreover, recommendations are presented by considering the application of user-defined relay characteristics that can be proved as a robust protection scheme to cope with the protection challenges in existing and future power systems developments. © 2013 IEEE.",Distribution networks (DN); microgrids (MG); protection coordination scheme; renewable energy resources (RES); user-defined characteristics (UDC),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101747075

With the emphasis and research on AUV, AUV path planning technology is continuously developing. Path planning techniques generally include environment modelling methods and path planning algorithms. Based on a brief description of the environment modelling methods, this paper focuses on the path planning algorithms commonly used by AUV. According to the basic principles of the algorithm, the AUV path planning algorithms are divided into four categories: artificial potential field methods, geometric model search methods, random sampling methods, and intelligent bionic methods. In this review, we summarize in detail the development and application of various path planning algorithms in recent years. Meanwhile, we analyse the advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms and their improvement methods. Obstacles, ocean currents, and undersea terrain have an impact on AUV path planning. Therefore, how to deal with the complex underwater environment adds some limits to AUV path planning algorithms. In addition to the external environment, path planning algorithms also need to consider AUV's physical constraints, such as energy constraints and motion constraints. Then, we analyse the motion constraints in AUV path planning. Finally, we discuss the development direction of AUV path planning algorithm. Time-varying ocean currents, special obstacles, multiobjective constraints, and practicability will be the problems that AUV path planning algorithms need to solve.

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid's load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model's performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform's effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is effectively used for energy crowdsourcing between the prosumer and consumer to attain service quality. © 2013 IEEE.",blockchain; energy prediction; Energy trading; machine learning; predictive analysis,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101538996

In this study, we investigate three-dimensional (3D) human skeleton-based gender classification using a novel gait feature called joint swing energy (JSE). JSE is a kinematic gait feature that represents how distant a model skeleton's body joints are from anatomical planes while walking. However, anatomical planes are conventionally obtained from single static poses rather than dynamic motion. Therefore, in this study, we further investigate a novel method for obtaining transverse, frontal, and median planes from a 3D gait sequence. Using these planes, each joint's movement can be represented by coordinates centered on a human body rather than 3D Cartesian coordinates. Using the proposed methods, we extract JSEs of body joints from 3D gait sequences. We show that JSEs are different between walking men and women and propose the use of JSEs for machine classification of human gender. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed JSE model on the gender classification task, we evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms trained using JSE on four publicly available datasets, referred to as Datasets A, B, C, and D. Dataset A includes gait sequences from 164 persons between the ages of 17 and 45. Dataset B contains gait sequences from 104 persons between the ages of 17 and 36. In Dataset C, there are gait sequences for 30 persons between the ages of 23 and 55. In Dataset D, gait sequences for 30 persons between the ages of 21 and 55 are contained. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves the highest classification accuracy and outperforms existing techniques for all datasets. These results suggest that human gender can be classified by JSEs extracted from the 3D gait sequence. © 2013 IEEE.",Feature extraction; gait; gender classification; human skeleton; machine learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101482279

CPS constitute the backbone of enterprise (e.g., smart cities), industrial (e.g., smart manufacturing), and critical infrastructure (e.g., energy systems). Thus, their vital importance, interoperability, and plurality of computing devices make them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature within the power grid infrastructure, can lead to disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced by leveraging testbed capabilities in order to replicate and understand power systems operating conditions, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. Adequately modeling and reproducing the behavior of CPS could be a challenging task. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with an emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models that can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables the system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS. © 2013 IEEE.",Cyber-physical systems; power grid; risk assessment; security; simulation; testbeds; threat modeling,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101439129

To ensure the success of any telemedicine program, there is a need to understand the patients’ satisfaction and their preferences. This review aims to collate and provide evidence related to practices that may influence the performance of telemedicine for patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We searched three electronic databases for studies examining patients’ satisfaction and preferences for using telemedicine in type 2 diabetes. An evaluation matrix was developed to collect the data from the included articles. A total of 20 articles were identified and data on the key outcomes identified were narratively synthesized. Results: Patients were generally satisfied with the use of telemedicine for management of type 2 diabetes. Users reported that telemedicine was beneficial as it provided constant monitoring, improved access to healthcare providers, and reduced waiting time. When adopting a telemedicine platform, most patients expressed preference for mobile health (mHealth) as the telemedicine modality, especially if it has been endorsed by their physician. To improve usability and sustainability, patients suggested that modules related to diabetes education be enhanced, together with sufficient technical and physician support when adopting telemedicine. Patients also expressed the importance of having a sufficiently flexible platform that could be adapted to their needs. Conclusion: Personalized telemedicine strategies coupled with appropriate physician endor-sement greatly influences a patient’s decision to undertake telemedicine. Future work should focus on improving telemedicine infrastructure and increasing physician’s involvement, especially during the implementation phase. © 2021 Sim and Lee.",MHealth; Preference; Review; Satisfaction; Telemedicine; Type 2 diabetes,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101063632

Over the last five decades, although different approaches have been proposed to solve the problem, no single approach has been shown to achieve satisfactory performances with quality solutions for a wide range of problems. This study presents a hybrid immune genetic algorithm (IGA) to solve NPV-based RCPSPs. Hybridizing a genetic algorithm (GA) with an immune algorithm (IA) enhances the overall performance of their standalone components (i.e., only GA or IA). Performance of the proposed IGA is further improved by applying a variable insertion based local search (VINS) and forward-backward improvement (FBI). A restart mechanism is presented to the algorithm which induces diversity and helps to avoid becoming trapped in local optima. Moreover, an activity move rule (AMR) is implemented to shift the negative cash flow associated activities to further improve the NPV. Taguchi Design of Experiment (DOE) is conducted to investigate the impact of various parameters and to determine the appropriate set of parameters for the proposed IGA. The performances of the proposed algorithms are tested on 17,280 standard benchmark instances ranging from 25 to 100 activities. Comparison with the state-of-art algorithms through extensive numerical experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Overall, the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, particularly the projects with 0% and 100% negative cash flow associated activities, the 75-activity instances, and the projects with two resources usage in terms of a lower value of average percentage deviation. © 2013 IEEE.",immune genetic algorithm; Net present value; RCPSPDC; resource constrained project scheduling,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101057926

However, the molecular mechanism of LUAD remains unclear. To reveal the laws in the occurrence and development of LUAD, this paper first collects 676 differentially expressed genes related to LUAD and the corresponding proteins encoded by the genes, resulting in a complex protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The traditional analysis methods focus on the gene interaction relationships or the important genes separately, ignoring the fact that some important target genes may take effect jointly. In contrast, this paper adopts a new analysis method named the overlapping gene analysis method to screen out the closely interacted and important genes. Thereinto, the hub genes are first discovered according to the node importance index, and then the PPI network is divided into multiple communities. The overlapping genes are some genes belonging to both the hub genes and the genes in the same community, regarded as gene groups. Through experiments, 10 genes are identified as a gene group. Survival analyses to the gene group show that only PLK1, CCNB1, and CDK1 participate in the prognosis of LUAD, and relate to the pathological stage of LUAD. These demonstrate that the three genes are extremely important in the cell cycle, which is confirmed by the following enrichment analyses. Besides, some significant correlations are observed among the three genes, which provide a clue that the three genes may cooperate in the occurrence and development of LUAD. This finding provides possible clinical targets for the diagnosis and treatment of LUAD. © 2013 IEEE.",cell cycle; community analysis; Complex protein network; hub gene analysis; tumor and cancer,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100510707

Credit Rate, an output of credit-rating process, reflects such creditworthiness. We reviewed literature on elements of credit rating, viz. Credit Rate, credit-rating agencies (CRAs) and credit-rating model. Credit Rating is an independent evaluation of creditworthiness. CRAs perform this evaluation to support financial institutions in processing debts. Literature added in credit-rating domain from January 2001 to November 2020 is analyzed to explore the opportunities for further research. Bibliometric analysis is used to comprehend the existing literature. Subsequently, through structured review theories, methodologies used by researchers and CRAs are explored. Further, a hybrid literature review is developed by integrating bibliometric and structured review of research papers from widely recognized databases. A sample of 153 papers is constructed and studied to identify gaps in credit-rating domain and to develop suitable remedy to fill such gaps. We found that most of the studies emerged as after-effects of financial crisis reported in 2008 and 2016. The review revealed that 48% studies focused on development of new credit-rating mechanism without evaluating existing structure in-depth. This paper contributes to existing literature by encouraging researchers and CRAs to develop a sector-specific credit-rating system by evaluating existing models and improvising them by adopting advanced techniques like Multiple Regression, Neural Networking and Artificial Intelligence. We have provided a feasible research agenda to further explore credit-rating domain. In this study we have identified that the factors determining creditworthiness are different for different sectors. © 2021 The Author(s).

The consequential disruptions force governments and societies to seek ways for their cities to become more humane, ethical, inclusive, intelligent, and sustainable. In recent years, the concept of City-as-a-Platform was coined with the hope of providing an innovative approach for addressing the aforementioned disruptions. Today, this concept is rapidly gaining popularity, as more and more platform thinking applications become available to the city context—so-called platform urbanism. These platforms used for identifying and addressing various urbanization problems with the assistance of open data, participatory innovation opportunity, and collective knowledge. With these developments in mind, this study aims to tackle the question of “How can platform urbanism support local governance efforts in the development of smarter cities?” Through an integrative review of journal articles published during the last decade, the evolution of City-as-a-Platform was analyzed. The findings revealed the prospects and constraints for the realization of transformative and disruptive impacts on the government and society through the platform urbanism, along with disclosing the opportunities and challenges for smarter urban development governance with collective knowledge through platform urbanism. © 2021 by the authors.

The attempt to converge towards a model of sustainable urban life, made difficult by increasing anthropic pressure and polluting activities conducted by man, is also reflected in the intentions of public institutions to take measures of environmental risk mitigation. The change towards more liveable cities must also include the adoption of more far-reaching measures in various sectors. The objective of our work was to provide an analysis in order to assess which of the Italian provincial municipalities were most closely related to the paradigm of SSCs. This aim was pursued through a comparison based on the results of a partially non-compensatory quantitative method, known as the Pena’s Distance method (DP2). The smartest and most sustainable cities, such as Siena, Milan and Padua, were not identified on the basis of common urban characteristics but rather derived from the combination of distinctive and functional elements in the pursuit of a strategic approach aimed at fully exploiting the resources of each area. Moreover, at a macro-geographical level, from the analysis emerged the presence of contiguous clusters, i.e., areas in which a major concentration of smart sustainable municipalities tended to form. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, the method quantitatively identifies the important but unsatisfied customer needs by analyzing online review data. To represent customer needs in a structured form, the job-to-be-done-based customer outcomes are adopted from the outcome-driven innovation (ODI) framework. Therefore, job-to-be-done information is extracted from the review data and is transformed into customer outcomes. The outcomes having high service opportunities are selected by metrics for quantifying the importance and satisfaction score of the outcomes. This paper conducted an empirical study for hotel service using relevant review data. The results show that the method can identify customer needs in hotel service—e.g., maximizing safety to pay price/deposit, and maximizing possibility to avoid waiting at lobby—and objectively prioritize strategic directions for service innovation. Therefore, the proposed method can be used as an intelligent tool for the effective development of a business strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

The short term power load forecasting of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is critical for effective operation and management of SG. Forecasting power load of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is challenging compared to aggregate load forecasting of a residential community. The main reason is the high volatility and uncertainty involved for the case of individual and group of similar energy customers. Several machine/deep learning models have been developed in the recent past for forecasting load of individual energy customers, but such explorations are ineffective due to the requirement of one trained model for every energy customer, which is practically not feasible. We plan to build a deep learning model using convolutional neural network (CNN) layers in pyramidal architecture for effective load forecasting for a group of similar energy-profile customers. Initially, we grouped a subset of energy customers from database of Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) into clusters using DBSCAN approach. The CNN layers are used for extracting feature from historical load of each cluster. The extracted feature of similar energy-profile customers (grouped based on clustering) is combined to make training-databases for each cluster. We have used the power load data from SGSC project, which contain thousands of individual household energy customers data. The developed Pyramid-CNN model is trained based on these sets of databases. The trained model is evaluated on randomly selected customers from few clusters. We obtained significantly improved forecasting results for randomly selected user from different clusters. Our adapted strategy of clustering based model training resulted in upto 10 percent MAPE improvement for the energy customers. The essence of our work is that energy customers can be grouped into clusters and then representative model could be developed/trained, which can accurately forecast power load for individual energy-customer. This approach is highly feasible, as we do not need to train a model per energy customer and still achieve competitive forecasting results. © 2013 IEEE.",Clusters; CNN; High energy consumers; Low energy consumers; Power load forecasting; Smart grids; Smart homes,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099723219

This algorithm is an improvement on the original deep deterministic police gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which incorporates ambient intelligence exploration. The DDPG algorithm serves as the core, and the AIEM-DDPG algorithm runs on a variety of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including soft actor-critic (SAC), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), proximal policy optimization (PPO) and double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithms, to attain distributed exploration in the environment. In addition, a classified priority experience replay mechanism is introduced to improve the exploration efficiency. Clipping multi-Q learning, policy delayed updating, target policy smooth regularization and other methods are utilized to solve the problem of Q-value overestimation.

However, the number of available pixel-wise labeled medical images is extremely small, and this prevents the application of CNNs in many medical image segmentation tasks. We proposed a self-paced learning with diversity SPLD) framework to boost the performances of medical image segmentation models with a limited amount of annotated data. Self-paced learning (SPL) is a learning regime that selects training samples in order from the easiest to the most difficult for model training. In addition, we took the diversity of the data into consideration. The proposed self-paced learning with diversity by query-by-committee (SPLD-QBC) algorithm dynamically and diversely selects the appropriate training data to boost the performance of an image segmentation model. SPLD-QBC incorporates the query-by-committee (QBC) technique for data selection and affinity propagation for optimizing the data diversity. By dynamically selecting the optimal sequence of training samples from different probability distributions, the segmentation models achieved improved performances. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPLD-QBC framework, we conducted experiments on three medical image segmentation tasks with five different datasets. The experimental results indicated that the proposed SPLD-QBC algorithm significantly improved upon the segmentation performances of the baseline models and resulted in a higher Dice score, surface distance and mean intersection over union (mIoU). The proposed SPLD significantly boosts the segmentation performances of models and is easily embedded into CNN-based image segmentation models. © 2013 IEEE.",deep learning; image segmentation; Self-paced learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099084416

The main objective of this study was to compare the performance of optical sensors, namely a depth camera (DC) and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) in estimating structural deflection. We also utilized bilateral filtering techniques, which are commonly used in image processing, on the point cloud data for enhancing their accuracy and increasing the application prospects of these sensors in structure health monitoring. The results from these sensors were validated by comparing them with the outputs from a linear variable differential transformer sensor, which was mounted on the beam during an indoor experiment. The results showed that the datasets obtained from both the sensors were acceptable for nominal deflections of 3 mm and above because the error range was less than ±10%. However, the result obtained from the TLS were better than those obtained from the DC. © 2020 by the authors.

At present, sustainable development in the area of public health is considered vital to securing a promising and prosperous future for humans. However, widespread diseases, such as COVID-19, create numerous challenges to this goal, and some of those challenges are not yet defined. In this study, a Shallow Single-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (SSLPNN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model were used for the classification and prediction of confirmed COVID-19 cases in five geographically distributed regions of Asia with diverse settings and environmental conditions: namely, China, South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Significant environmental and non-environmental features were taken as the input dataset, and confirmed COVID-19 cases were taken as the output dataset. A correlation analysis was done to identify patterns in the cases related to fluctuations in the associated variables. The results of this study established that the population and air quality index of a region had a statistically significant influence on the cases. However, age and the human development index had a negative influence on the cases. The proposed SSLPNN-based classification model performed well when predicting the classes of confirmed cases. During training, the binary classification model was highly accurate, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.91. Likewise, the results of the regression analysis using the GPR technique with Matern 5/2 were highly accurate (RMSE = 0.95239) when predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an area. However, dynamic management has occupied a core place in studies on the sustainable development of public health but dynamic management depends on proactive strategies based on statistically verified approaches, like Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this study, an SSLPNN model has been trained to fit public health associated data into an appropriate class, allowing GPR to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an area based on the given values of selected parameters. Therefore, this tool can help authorities in different ecological settings effectively manage COVID-19. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

In Korea, the National Strategic Smart City Program (NSSP) was launched to establish a new technological ecosystem and standards for smart cities. In this study, we introduce the smart city services being developed by the Korean NSSP and compare them to services offered in 15 smart cities in Europe, Asia, and North America. The NSSP services are characterized by applications of 5G telecommunication technology and the definition of its data structure. These characteristics are unique; unlike other existing smart city policies, the NSSP aims to widen the industrial territory of the smart city itself.

The security and protection of such personal information are becoming more and more important since mobile devices are vulnerable to unauthorized access or theft. User authentication is a task of paramount importance that grants access to legitimate users at the point of entry and continuously through the usage session. This task is made possible with today's smartphones' embedded sensors that enable continuous and implicit user authentication by capturing behavioral biometrics and traits. In this article, we survey more than 140 recent behavioral biometric-based approaches for continuous user authentication, including motion-based methods (28 studies), gait-based methods (19 studies), keystroke dynamics-based methods (20 studies), touch gesture-based methods (29 studies), voice-based methods (16 studies), and multimodal-based methods (34 studies).

A typical approach to summarize a photo collection is dividing it into events and selecting key photos from each event. Despite the fact that a certain event comprises several sub-events, few studies have proposed sub-event segmentation. We propose the sentiment analysis-based photo summarization (SAPS) method, which automatically summarizes personal photo collections by utilizing metadata and visual sentiment features. For this purpose, we first cluster events using metadata of photos and then calculate the novelty scores to determine the sub-event boundaries. Next, we summarize the photo collections using a ranking algorithm that measures sentiment, emotion, and aesthetics. We evaluate the proposed method by applying it to the photo collections of six participants consisting of 5,480 photos in total. We observe that our sub-event segmentation based on sentiment features outperforms the existing baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is also more effective in finding sub-event boundaries and key photos, because it focuses on detailed sentiment features instead of general content features. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Event segmentation; Key photo selection; Personal photo collection; Sentiment analysis; Summarization,Article,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096907457

We employ a longitudinal mobility dataset describing human interactions with Foursquare venues in ten global cities: Chicago, Istanbul, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo. This social media data provides spatio-temporally referenced digital traces left by human use of urban environments, giving us access to the intangible aspects of urban life, such as people behaviours and preferences. Our framework capitalizes on these new data sources, bringing about a novel Geographic Data Science and human-centered methodological approach. Combining network science – a study area with great promise for the analysis of cities and their structure – with geospatial analysis methods, we model cities as a series of global urban networks. Through a spatially weighted community detection algorithm, we uncover functional neighbourhoods for the ten global cities. Each neighbourhood is linked to hyper-local characterisations of their built environment for the Foursquare venues that compose them, and complemented with a range of measures describing their diversity, morphology and mobility. This information is used in a clustering exercise that uncovers a set of four functional neighbourhood types. Our results enable the profiling and comparison of functional neighbourhoods, based on human dynamics and their contexts, across the sample of global cities. The framework is portable to other geographic contexts where interaction data are available to bind different localities into functional agglomerations, and provide insight into their contextual and human dynamics. © 2020",Foursquare; Geographic data science; Urban analytics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096213287

Pathological examinations are being the gold standard in many haematology and histophathology, and also play a key role in the diagnosis of diseases. In clinical diagnosis, white blood cells are analysed by pathologists from peripheral blood smears samples of patients. This analysis is mainly based on morphological features and characteristics of the white blood cells and their nuclei and cytoplasm, including, shapes, sizes, colours, textures, maturity stages and staining processes. Recently, Computer Aided Diagnosis techniques have been rapidly growing in the digital haematology area related to white blood cells, and their nuclei and cytoplasm detection, as well as their segmentation and classification techniques. In digital haematology image analysis, these techniques have played and will continue to play, a vital role for providing traceable clinical information, consolidating pertinent second opinions, and minimizing human intervention. This study outlines, discusses, and introduces the major trends from a particular review of detection and segmentation methods for white blood cells and their nuclei and cytoplasm from digital haematology microscope images. Performance of existing methods have been comprehensively compared, taking into account databases used, number of images and limitations. This study can also help us to identify the challenges that remain, in achieving a robust analysis of white blood cell microscope images, which could support the diagnosis of blood disorders and assist researchers and pathologists in the future. The impact of this work is to enhance the accuracy of pathologists' decisions and their efficiency, and overall benefit the patients for faster and more accurate diagnosis. The significant of the paper on intelligent system is that provides future potential techniques for solving overlapping white blood cell identification and other problems microscopic images.

This paper aims to understand these relationships in an informal settlement–a kampong–at the edge of the upscale Menteng district, Jakarta. We applied a mixed-methods approach of (1) a computational street network analysis using space syntax, (2) video analysis to understand travel behaviour and land use and (3) an analysis of street users’ experiences collected through interviews. Our findings indicated that the pedestrian accessibility was not fully realised due to unsupportive land uses and negative perceptions of walking experienced by kampong inhabitants.

The damage estimates from these models depend on many variables and their complex sometimes nonlinear relationships with the damage. In recent years, data-driven modeling techniques have been used to capture those relationships. The available data to build such models are often limited. Therefore, in practice it is usually necessary to transfer models to a different context. In this article, we show that this implies the samples used to build the model are often not fully representative for the situation where they need to be applied on, which leads to a “sample selection bias.” In this article, we enhance data-driven damage models by applying methods, not previously applied to damage modeling, to correct for this bias before the machine learning (ML) models are trained. We demonstrate this with case studies on flooding in Europe, and typhoon wind damage in the Philippines. Two sample selection bias correction methods from the ML literature are applied and one of these methods is also adjusted to our problem. These three methods are combined with stochastic generation of synthetic damage data. We demonstrate that for both case studies, the sample selection bias correction techniques reduce model errors, especially for the mean bias error this reduction can be larger than 30%. The novel combination with stochastic data generation seems to enhance these techniques. This shows that sample selection bias correction methods are beneficial for damage model transfer. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis",damage modeling; disaster risk management; domain adaptation; flood risk management; loss modeling; machine learning; sample selection bias correction,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089696339

The aim of this study was to identify and review operational research approaches to support decision-making in home health care. We identified a set of linked decisions at different planning levels (strategic, tactical, operational) and conducted a systematic review of operational research approaches used to address these decisions. We also sampled OR literature applied to analogous decisions in other settings. The 77 papers selected focused predominantly on solutions for staff-to-patient allocation, visit scheduling and staff routing, few of which were adopted by organisations. Few studies dealt with tactical decisions of team size and composition or strategic decisions of districting, and we found no studies on contract design for commissioning home health care, on staff role definitions or on reassessment of patient need. Integrative work is scarce and the aspects of system performance considered are variable and diverse. For these reasons the literature does not provide guidance for home health care services aspiring to effective and coherent decisions across planning levels. OR approaches from other areas of application provide some insights for future research aimed at addressing this shortfall. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this paper, we introduce the union of SA and CBR, tied to machine learning algorithms for proposing a system to predict PPs, supporting specialists in their clinical decisions. To evaluate the system, we implemented it in a software architecture prototype and evaluated the prototypes using a knowledge base containing near one hundred thousand audio files, collected from more than 1,000 pronunciation assessments. The evaluation of the prototypes showed an accuracy over 93% in the prediction of PPs, resulting in a efficient tool for clinical decision support and therapeutic planning.

A novelty of this study is the quantitative prioritisation and comparison, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, of the disturbances reported by two groups of managers: three product managers (internally facing) and four supply chain managers (externally facing). Our findings show that managers’ perceptions of firm-related, network-related and location-related disturbances can be prejudiced by their functional boundaries. We show that both product and supply chain managers prefer the insource/nearshore outsource strategy, as they feel that the disturbances while outsourcing/offshoring are significantly greater and offset the benefits of low-cost production–a counterintuitive finding.

Specifically, the building energy management system operator is responsible for setting internal uniform prices of their own rooftop PV productions to facilitate the local PV energy sharing with apartment building users, aiming to maximise the economic profits. To protect the privacy of apartment building users and meanwhile improve the computational efficiency, a neural network is designed for simulating their demand response (DR) behaviours. Besides, the uncertain rooftop PV generations can be duly addressed by using a well-trained long short-term memory network, which can capture the future trends of rooftop PV generations in a rolling-horizon manner. With the information on PV predictions and DR results, a model-free reinforcement learning method is developed for finding the near-optimal dynamic pricing strategy.

However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Energy efficiency; Green Networking; Internet of Things; IoT,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089430260

The episodes include an elevated haze event of 16 days (14–29 January 2015) for the first episode and 8 days (19–26 December 2017) for the second episode, together with some days before and after the haze event. Daily PM2.5 was found to be 50 µg m?3 or higher over most of the days during both haze events. These haze events commonly have cold surges as the background synoptic feature to initiate or trigger haze evolution. A cold surge reached the study area before the start of each haze event, causing temperature and relative humidity to drop abruptly initially but then gradually increased as the cold surge weakened or dissipated. Wind speed was relatively high when the cold surge was active. Global radiation was generally modulated by cloud cover, which turns relatively high during each haze event because cold surge induces less cloud. Daytime dynamic stability was generally unstable along the course of each haze event, except being stable at the ending of the second haze event due to a tropical depression. In each haze event, low-level temperature inversion existed, with multiple layers seen in the beginning, effectively suppressing atmospheric dilution. Large-scale subsidence inversion aloft was also persistently present. In both episodes, PM2.5 showed stronger diurnality during the time of elevated haze, as compared to the pre-and post-haze periods. During the first episode, an apparent contrast of PM2.5 diurnality was seen between the first and second parts of the haze event with relatively low afternoon PM2.5 over its first part, but relatively high afternoon PM2.5 over its second part, possibly due to the role of secondary aerosols. PM2.5 /PM10 ratio was relatively lower in the first episode because of more impact of biomass burning, which was in general agreement with back-trajectories and active fire hotspots. The second haze event, with little biomass burning in the region, was likely to be caused mainly by local anthropogenic emissions. These findings suggest a need for haze-related policymaking with an integrated approach that accounts for all important emission sectors for both particulate and gaseous precursors of secondary aerosols. Given that cold surges induce an abrupt change in local meteorology, the time window to apply control measures for haze is limited, emphasizing the need for readiness in mitigation responses and early public warning. © 2020 by the authors.

However, very little is known about Social Media’s (SM) role in creating Small and Medium-sized Enterprises’ (SMEs’) financial sustainability. Drawing upon the Technology Organisational and Environmental (TOE) framework, the authors constructed a comprehensive model that examined the role of different factors in the adoption of SM by SMEs in developing countries (using Pakistan as an example). Using a questionnaire survey of 383 owners/managers of SMEs in Pakistan, the research findings determined the different factors (i.e., organisational, technological, and environmental), which can impact the adoption of SM by SMEs. In line with previous research studies, the results of structural equation modelling show that technological factors such as perceived benefits of SM, compatibility of SM, cost, and trust have a substantial effect on SMEs’ SM adoption. Similarly, both organisational factors: top management support and technological competence, are strong predictors of SM adoption in SMEs. Finally, environmental factors (i.e., competitor pressure, customer pressure, and information intensity) positively impacted SM adoption by SMEs. The effect of SM adoption on SMEs’ financial sustainability was also tested and found to be positive and significant. Several theoretical and practical implications for owners/managers and other stakeholders regarding SM’s successful implementation by SMEs are highlighted within the paper. © 2020 by the authors.

The worst of these fires coincide with El Niño related droughts, and include huge areas of smouldering combustion that can persist for months. However, areas of flaming surface vegetation combustion atop peat are also seen, and we show that the largest of these latter fires appear to be the most radiant and intensely smoke-emitting areas of combustion present in such extreme fire episodes. Fire emissions inventories and early warning of the air quality impacts of landscape fire are increasingly based on the fire radiative power (FRP) approach to fire emissions estimation, including for these SE Asia peatland fires. “Top-down” methods estimate total particulate matter emissions directly from FRP observations using so-called “smoke emission coefficients” [Ce; g·MJ?1], but currently no discrimination is made between fire types during such calculations. We show that for a subset of some of the most thermally radiant peatland fires seen during the 2015 El Niño, the most appropriate Ce is around a factor of three lower than currently assumed (~16.8 ± 1.6 g·MJ?1 vs. 52.4 g·MJ?1). Analysis indicates that this difference stems from these highly radiant fires containing areas of substantial flaming combustion, which changes the amount of particulate matter emitted per unit of observable fire radiative heat release in comparison to more smouldering dominated events. We also show that even a single one of these most radiant fires is responsible for almost 10% of the overall particulate matter released during the 2015 fire event, highlighting the importance of this fire type to overall emission totals. Discriminating these different fires types in ways demonstrated herein should thus ultimately improve the accuracy of SE Asian fire emissions estimates derived using the FRP approach, and the air quality modelling which they support. © 2020 by the authors.

In this article, the questions we ask are: What trends do we see in the topics that occur in journal articles on the energy transition? And to what extent has public policy been a focus? Where do we need or see energy transitions happening? Our approach involves: (1) using two literature databases to identify 4875 relevant ET articles over the period 1970-2018; (2) identifying important topics within ET using topic modeling via latent Dirichlet allocation on the abstracts of the articles; and (3) conducting a robustness check on the topics and analysis on the policy-relevant topics. This study contributes to the ETs research by providing the first systematic overview of peer-reviewed articles on ETs. We find that the number of academic articles covering ETs has increased by nearly a factor of 50 since 2008, 67% of them are policy related. Research on governance is pervasive in the literature and contains multiple topics differentiated by substantive foci. Some topics on the social-technical, social-behavioral, and political aspects of transition governance are becoming increasingly popular. Network analysis shows transition governance, energy economics and climate implications, and energy technologies comprise the three largest clusters of topics, but we observe a lack of connectedness between governance topics and technology topics. In the policy-relevant literature, we see a growing number of articles on technological and institutional innovation, and examples from leader countries, especially in Europe. We find only a quarter of articles discussed ETs in developing countries, which is not aligned with a recurring theme, their importance to the global ET. © Original content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

As a contribution to mitigate such effects caused by the transportation sector, the full adoption of electric mobility is increasingly being seen as the main alternative to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, which is supported by positive industry indicators, despite some identified hurdles. For such objective, power electronics technologies play an essential role and can be contextualized in different purposes to support the full adoption of electric mobility, including on-board and off-board battery charging systems, inductive wireless charging systems, unified traction and charging systems, new topologies with innovative operation modes for supporting the electrical power grid, and innovative solutions for electrified railways. Embracing all of these aspects, this paper presents a review on power electronics technologies for electric mobility where some of the main technologies and power electronics topologies are presented and explained. In order to address a broad scope of technologies, this paper covers road vehicles, lightweight vehicles and railway vehicles, among other electric vehicles. © 2020 MDPI AG.

Although the domains of smart grid applications and technologies vary in functions and forms, they generally share common potentials such as intelligent energy curtailment, efficient integration of Demand Response, Distributed Renewable Generation, and Energy Storage. This paper presents a comprehensive review categorically on the recent advances and previous research developments of the smart grid paradigm over the last two decades. The main intent of the study is to provide an application-focused survey where every category and sub-category herein are thoroughly and independently investigated. The preamble of the paper highlights the concept and the structure of the smart grids. The work presented intensively and extensively reviews the recent advances on the energy data management in smart grids, pricing modalities in a modernized power grid, and the predominant components of the smart grid. The paper thoroughly enumerates the recent advances in the area of network reliability. On the other hand, the reliance on smart cities on advanced communication infrastructure promotes more concerns regarding data integrity. Therefore, the paper dedicates a sub-section to highlight the challenges and the state-of-the-art of cybersecurity.

An alternative way for acid resistance evaluation is to predict the sample deterioration through machine learning methods using a currently available database. However, current predictive models have failed to include testing conditions, which limits their applications to certain testing conditions. Accordingly, predictive models need to be developed to include parameters of both mixture design and testing conditions in the forecasting of deterioration of mortar under sulfuric acid attack. In this study, such predictive models were established using the Bayesian optimized-support vector regression (BO-SVR) algorithm. Prediction errors were calculated, and a superiority test was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BO-SVR models. It was found that the proposed BO-SVR model outperformed the other models in predicting the mass change and the compressive strength.

National and international authorities concentrate efforts on developing early warning systems (EWS) to deliver flood alerts and prevent loss of lives and damages. Usually, regional EWS are based on hydrological modeling, while local EWS adopt field observations. This study aims to integrate outputs from two regional hydrological models—Niger HYPE (NH) and World-Wide HYPE (WWH)—in a local EWS developed for the Sirba River. Sirba is the major tributary of Middle Niger River Basin and is supported by a local EWS since June 2019. Model evaluation indices were computed with 5-day forecasts demonstrating a better performance of NH (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency NSE = 0.58) than WWH (NSE = 0.10) and the need of output optimization. The optimization conducted with a linear regression post-processing technique improves performance significantly to “very good” for NH (Heidke skill score HSS = 0.53) and “good” for WWH (HSS = 0.28). HYPE outputs allow to extend local EWS warning lead-time up to 10 days. Since the transfer informatic environment is not yet a mature operational system 10–20% of forecasts were unfortunately not produced in 2019, impacting operational availability. © 2020 by the authors.

For that purpose, some meteorological parameters, physical-geographical factors and the flood events data were studied for the 1994–2019 period. The linear trends demonstrate an increasing tendency of air temperature and precipitation. Those trends expressed increased flood occurrences, especially for the 2000s, whereas the Mann– Kendall (MK) trend test reveals no significant change. The number of flood events reaches its maximum in 2011 with its peak in May. Out of 191 flood events, half of the occurrences are recorded in the flat areas and southern aspects of the mountains (22% of the country’s territory). There is a certain clustering of flood events in the areas with up to 5° slopes (66% of flood events). The most flood vulnerable areas were analyzed and mapped via Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based mapping shows the location of flood vulnerable areas in the central, northern parts of the country, and the coastal areas of Lake Sevan.

Especially, according to existing studies, a novel type of botnet, which is the so-called steganography-based botnet (stego-botnet), can be constructed and implemented in SNS chat messengers. In the stego-botnet, by using various steganography techniques, every botnet communication and control (C&C) messages are secretly embedded into multimedia files (such as image or video files) frequently shared in the SNS messenger. As a result, the stego-botnet can hide its malicious messages between a bot master and bots much better than existing botnets by avoiding traditional botnet-detection methods without steganography-detection functions. Meanwhile, existing studies have focused on devising and improving steganography-detection algorithms but no studies conducted automated steganography image-detection system although there are a large amount of SNS chatrooms on the Internet and thus may exist many potential steganography images on those chatrooms which need to be inspected for security. Consequently, in this paper, we propose an automated system that detects steganography image files by collecting and inspecting all image files shared in an SNS chatroom based on open image steganography tools. In addition, we implement our proposed system based on two open steganography tools (Stegano and Cryptosteganography) in the KakaoTalk SNS messenger and show our experimental results that validate our proposed automated detection system work successfully according to our design purposes. © 2020 by the authors.

Exploiting the continuous-time dynamics of a network of coupled phase-transition nano-oscillators (PTNOs) allows building an Ising Hamiltonian solver for obtaining optimum or near-optimum solution with a large speed-up over discrete-time iterative digital hardware. Here, we provide insights into the continuous-time dynamics of such a PTNO-based Ising Hamiltonian solver. We highlight the formation of stable attractor states in the phase space of the coupled PTNO network using second-harmonic injection locking (SHIL) that corresponds to the minima of the Ising Hamiltonian. We show that the emergent synchronized dynamics of the PTNO network is maximized near the critical point of oscillator phase bistability beyond which the dynamics is limited by freeze-out effects. Such dynamical freeze-out severely limits the performance of the PTNO-based Ising solver from obtaining the global optimum. We highlight an improvement in the success probability of reaching the ground state by introducing an annealing scheme with linearly increasing SHIL amplitude compared with a constant SHIL. Finally, we estimate the 'effective temperature' of the PTNO-based Ising solver by comparing it with the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The PTNO-based Ising solver behaves like a low-temperature Ising spin system, indicating its effectiveness for optimization tasks. © 2014 IEEE.",Injection-locked oscillators; Ising machine; nonlinear dynamical systems; optimization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098780759

Therefore, our study concentrated on the main components of the SIoT (Architecture, Relation Management, Trust Management, web services, and information), features, parameters, and challenges. To gather enough information for better analysis, we have reviewed the articles published between 2011 and December 2019. The strengths and weaknesses of each article are examined, and effective evaluation parameters, approaches, and the most used simulation tools in this field are discussed.

PbD is a general philosophy that demonstrates privacy should not be overviewed as an afterthought, but rather as a first-class requirement in the design of IT systems. This study explores the effects of applying PbD to preserve privacy and personal data protection in MCC, and is focused on the privacy of personal data. In this exploration, a framework using PbD has been demonstrated, and seven hypotheses were formulated. Moreover, a survey was implemented where 386 responses were used to test the formulated hypotheses. The results of this study supported the perceived benefits, cues to action of PbD, and perceived threat are positively and directly related to privacy and personal data protection behavior in MCC. Moreover, the results supported that the perceived barriers are negatively and directly related to privacy and personal data protection behavior in MCC.

An additional 42% energy saving can be achieved when a lighter version of OPIUM method is used for training with the same number of data samples lead to no significant compromise on the quality of inference. Instead of a single classifier with large number of neurons, an ensemble of K base learner (BL) approach is chosen to reduce learning memory by a factor of K. This also enables approximate computing by dynamically varying the neural network size based on anomaly detection. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, the ADIC has K=7 BLs with 32 neurons in each BL and dissipates 11.87 and 3.35 pJ/OP during learning and inference, respectively, at Vdd=0.75 V when all seven BLs are enabled. Furthermore, evaluated on the NASA bearing data set, approximately 80% of the chip can be shut down for 99% of the lifetime leading to an energy efficiency of 0.48 pJ/OP, an 18.5 × reduction over full-precision computing running at Vdd=1.2 V throughout the lifetime. © 1993-2012 IEEE.",Anomaly detection; approximate computing; edge computing; energy savings; Internet of Things; one class classification; predictive maintenance (PdM),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097353599

On the other hand, WRF-ARW (Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research WRF) provides the results solving the 3D time-integrated, compressible, and non-hydrostatic Euler equations, but time-consuming. To shed light on their discrepancies for storm surge predictions, the storm surges of 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Leyte Gulf and the San Pedro Bay are selected. The Holland wind model predicts strong southeastern winds in the San Pedro Bay after Haiyan makes landfall at the Leyte Island than WRF-ARW 3 km and WRF-ARW 1 km. The storm surge simulation driven by the Holland wind model finds that the water piles up in the San Pedro Bay and its maximum computed storm surges are almost twice than those driven by WRF-ARW. This study also finds that the storm surge prediction in the San Pedro Bay is sensitive to winds, which can be affected by the landfall location, the storm intensity, and the storm forward speed. The numerical experiment points out that the maximum storm surges can be amplified by more 5–6% inside the San Pedro Bay if Haiyan’s forward speed is increased by 10%. © 2020 by the authors.

The stocking rate/animal production relationship has been a successful concept for pastoralists wanting to avoid degradation and/or raise incomes. However, there are no means available of alerting pastoralists to the approach of critical thresholds that would 'flip' rangelands into alternative states when grazing-stressed. Critical threshold forecasting for avoiding degradation (and seizing restoration opportunities) could be made available online. Research has yet to find, assemble and test the set of indicators needed to forecast the approach of critical thresholds envisaged in State-and-Transition thinking. Forecasting at paddock, property and regional scales would have to involve high-performance computing because the thresholds will be space and time dependent. The case for Australia and China to contribute cooperatively to this research effort rests on the large number of contrasting rangeland ecosystems across the two countries that represent rangelands globally. A proven history of past collaboration is extant with existing research programs on plant population dynamics, landscape patchiness/leakiness and soil biota status, and their responses to the separate and combined effects of climate and grazing animals. The road to adoption would involve partnerships with pastoralists throughout the process, remote sensing to identify approaching thresholds in real time, application of high-performance computing and possibly artificial intelligence, and packaging of forecasts for different socio-economic rangeland systems. © 2020 Journal Compilation",Australia; biodiversity conservation; China; critical threshold forecasting; defoliation; drought rangeland management; grazing stress; rangeland ecology; soil biology,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097281075

Although CC holds a large number of resources, it may not be acceptable by real-time mobile applications, as it is usually far away from users geographically. On the other hand, edge computing (EC), which distributes resources to the network edge, enjoys increasing popularity in the applications with low-latency and high-reliability requirements. EC provides resources in a decentralized manner, which can respond to users' requirements faster than the normal CC, but with limited computing capacities. As both CC and EC are resource-sensitive, several big issues arise, such as how to conduct job scheduling, resource allocation, and task offloading, which significantly influence the performance of the whole system. To tackle these issues, many optimization problems have been formulated. These optimization problems usually have complex properties, such as non-convexity and NP-hardness, which may not be addressed by the traditional convex optimization-based solutions. Computational intelligence (CI), consisting of a set of nature-inspired computational approaches, recently exhibits great potential in addressing these optimization problems in CC and EC. This article provides an overview of research problems in CC and EC and recent progresses in addressing them with the help of CI techniques.

According to this approach, urban space should be implemented from the position of improving the quality of life of citizens. As part of the development of a smart city, rational and economical use of resources is assumed. This attitude to resources allows not only to save resources but also to improve the quality of life of the population, particularly by improving the environmental situation in the regions. In the world practice of developing cities, the recycling processes are becoming more and more relevant. On the one hand, this saves material and energy resources. On the other hand, these measures help to improve the quality of the environment in the regions. Recently, two concepts have become a trend in the development of urban economy in world practice. One of them is the concept of a smart city, the other is the concept of sustainable urban development. Despite a number of differences, both approaches to city management imply a focus on environmental friendliness. Implementing strategies of development of Russian cities in the framework of the concept of sustainable development and within the concept of smart cities aims to improve the environmental situation in the country. Therefore, the aim of the research was to improve the environmental potential of Russian regions through the use of modern Russian and foreign research, in particular through the tire recycling program. For Russia, one of the key environmental problems is the problem of recycling car tires. Despite the emergence of new eco-friendly ways of recycling tire waste, it is becoming more acute every year. This is understandable, because the number of cars increases every year. Currently, decommissioned tires are a source of environmental pollution in most of the Russian regions. However, this source of pollution is a long-term source. This is due to the fact that worn tires are practically not susceptible to natural decomposition, and, as a result, require increasing space for their storage and disposal. The article provides an analysis of the dynamics and prospects of car tire recycling in the framework of the concept of sustainable development of smart cities. A comparative analysis of the state of this issue in Russian and foreign practice is presented. In addition, according to statistic analysis, the article provides a forecast analysis of the increase in waste in the form of tires and an analysis of the regulatory framework governing the recycling process. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.",Circular economy; Economic effect; Resource-saving technologies; Smart city; Sustainable city; Tire recycling; Waste management,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097049224

The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of an intervention aimed at raising the academic performance of students using an in-home CAL program. According to intention-to-treat estimates, in-home CAL improved the overall math scores of students in the treatment group relative to the control group by 0.08 to 0.20 standard deviations (depending on whether the treatment was for one or two semesters). Furthermore, Average Treatment Effect on the Treated analysis was used for solving the compliance problem in our experiment, showing that in-home CAL raised academic performance by 0.36 standard deviations among compliers. This study thus presents preliminary evidence that an in-home CAL program has the potential to boost the learning outcomes of disadvantaged students. © 2020 by the authors.

After illustrating the basic definitions related to particulate matter (PM) and its measurements according to international regulations, the device’s operating principle is presented, focusing on a discussion of the several characterization methodologies proposed by various research groups, both in the lab and in the field, along with their possible limitations. We present an extensive review of the LCPMS currently available on the market, their electronic characteristics, and their applications in published literature and from specific tests. Most of the reviewed LCPMS can accurately monitor PM changes in the environment and exhibit good performances with accuracy that, in some conditions, can reach R2 values up to 0.99. However, such results strongly depend on whether the device is calibrated or not (using a reference method) in the operative environment; if not, R2 values lower than 0.5 are observed. © 2020 by the authors.

The model aims to design an efficient system for providing municipal services by integrating the decisions regarding urban area districting and the location of waste collection centers. Three objectives are minimized, given as 1) the cost of establishing collection centers and collecting waste, 2) a measure of destructive environmental consequences, and 3) a measure of social dissatisfaction. Constraints are formulated to enforce an exclusive assignment of urban areas to districts and that the created districts are contiguous. In addition, constraints make sure that districts are compact and that they are balanced in terms of the amount of waste collected. A multi-objective local search heuristic using the farthest-candidate method is implemented to solve medium and large-scale numerical instances, while small instances can be solved directly by commercial software. A set of randomly generated test instances is used to test the effectiveness of the heuristic. The model and the heuristic are then applied to two case studies from Iran. The obtained results indicate that waste collection costs can be reduced by an estimated 20–30%, while significantly improving the performance with respect to environmental and social criteria. Thus, the provided approach can provide important decision support for making strategic choices in municipal solid waste management. © 2020 The Authors",Best-worst method; Local search; Multi-objective optimization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095995500

Data-centric computing (DCC), as enabled by processing-in-memory (PIM) and near-memory processing (NMP) paradigms, aims to accelerate these types of applications by moving the computation closer to the data. Over the past few years, researchers have proposed various memory architectures that enable DCC systems, such as logic layers in 3D-stacked memories or charge-sharing-based bitwise operations in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). However, application-specific memory access patterns, power and thermal concerns, memory technology limitations, and inconsistent performance gains complicate the offloading of computation in DCC systems. Therefore, designing intelligent resource management techniques for computation offloading is vital for leveraging the potential offered by this new paradigm.

Next, a designed feed–forward convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained based on the dataset to estimate several morphological, hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics of the porous material in a fraction of a second. In order to fine–tune the CNN design, we tested 9 different training scenarios and selected the one with the highest average coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.885 for 1418 testing samples.

A centralized solution relying on collecting and storing user traces and location information on a central server can provide more accurate and timely actions than a decentralized solution in combating viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19. However, centralized solutions are more prone to privacy breaches and privacy attacks by malevolent third parties than decentralized solutions, storing the information in a distributed manner among wireless networks. Thus, it is of timely relevance to identify and summarize the existing privacy-preserving solutions, focusing on decentralized methods, and analyzing them in the context of mobile device-based localization and tracking, contact tracing, and proximity detection. Wearables and other mobile Internet of Things devices are of particular interest in our study, as not only privacy, but also energy-efficiency, targets are becoming more and more critical to the end-users. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of user location-tracking, proximity-detection, and digital contact-tracing solutions in the literature from the past two decades, analyses their advantages and drawbacks concerning centralized and decentralized solutions, and presents the authors’ thoughts on future research directions in this timely research field. © 2020 by the authors.

Over the last three decades, the demand for various minerals has steadily increased, while the mineral processing industry has seen an unavoidable increase in the treatment of complex ores, continuous decline in plant feed grade and poor plant performance partly due to blending of ores with dissimilar properties. Despite these challenges, production plant data that are routinely generated are usually underutilised. In this contribution and aligned with the direction of the 4th industrial revolution, we highlight the value of legacy metallurgical plant data and the concept of a dry laboratory approach. This study is presented in two parts. In the current paper (Part I), a comprehensive review of the potential for the combination of modern analytical technology with data analytics to generate a new competence for process optimisation are provided. To demonstrate the value of data within the extractive metallurgy discipline, we employ data analytics and simulation to examine gold plant performance and the flotation process in two separate case studies in the second paper (Part II). This was done with the aim of showcasing relevant plant data insights, and extract parameters that should be targeted for plant design and performance optimisation. We identify several promising technologies that integrate well with existing mineral processing plants and testing laboratories to exploit the concept of a dry laboratory, in order to enhance pre-existing mineral processing chains. It also sets the passage in terms of the value of innovative analysis of existing and simulation data as part of the new world of data analytics. Using data- and technology-driven initiatives, we propose the establishment of dry laboratories and data banks to ultimately leverage integrated data, analytics and process simulation for effective plant design and improved performance. © 2020 The Authors",Data analytics; Data bank; Dry laboratories; Legacy metallurgical data,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091659429

For instance, with the emergence of distributed applications, several providers are usually correlating their records, and providing personalized services to their clients. Collected data include geographical and indoor positions of users, their movement patterns as well as sensor-acquired data that may reveal users' physical conditions, habits and interests. Consequently, this may lead to undesired consequences such as unsolicited advertisement and even to discrimination and stalking. To mitigate privacy threats, several techniques emerged, referred to as Privacy Enhancing Technologies, PETs for short. On one hand, the increasing pressure on service providers to protect users' privacy resulted in PETs being adopted. One the other hand, service providers have built their business model on personalized services, e.g. targeted ads and news. The objective of the paper is then to identify which of the PETs have the potential to satisfy both usually divergent - economical and ethical - purposes. This paper identifies a taxonomy classifying eight categories of PETs into three groups, and for better clarity, it considers three categories of personalized services. After defining and presenting the main features of PETs with illustrative examples, the paper points out which PETs best fit each personalized service category. Then, it discusses some of the inter-disciplinary privacy challenges that may slow down the adoption of these techniques, namely: technical, social, legal and economic concerns.

The test has been conducted on the data collected from consumers aged 60 years and over, with regard to three product purchases. The primary data used to explore the purchasing behaviour patterns was collected during a survey carried out among the elderly students at the Universities of Third Age in Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland, in the years 2017–2018. Finally, a total of six different types of purchasing patterns have been identified, namely the ‘thoughtful decision’, the ‘sensitive to recommendation’, the ‘beneficiary, the ‘short thoughtful decision’, the ‘habitual decision’ and ‘multiple’ patterns.The most significant differences in the purchasing patterns of the three national samples have been identified with regard to the process of purchasing a smartphone, while the most repetitive patterns have been identified with regard to the purchasing of a new product. The results significantly support the GNG network’s validity for identification of consumer behaviour patterns. The application of this method allowed quick and effective to identify and segment consumers groups as well as facilitated the mapping of the differences among these groups and to compare the consumption behaviour expressed by consumers on different markets.

Thus, unlike traditional KAF formulations, prediction uses not only their local models but also the individual local models learned from other stocks, enhancing prediction accuracy.

For systematic landslide mitigation and management, landslide evaluation and hazard zonation is required. Over the past few decades several techniques have been developed that can be used for landslide evaluation and zonation. These techniques can broadly be classified into qualitative and quantitative approaches. Qualitative approaches include geomorphological analysis and heuristic techniques whereas quantitative approaches include statistical, artificial intelligence and deterministic techniques. In quantitative techniques prediction for landslide susceptibility is based on the actual realistic data and interpretations. Further, the quantitative techniques also overcome the subjectivity of qualitative approaches. Each of these techniques may consider different causative factors and utilizes various means for factor evaluation and analysis. When compared, each of these techniques has its own advantage and disadvantage over other techniques. The selection of appropriate technique for landslide hazard evaluation and zonation is very crucial. The factors that need to be considered to adopt an appropriate approach are; investigation purpose, the extent of the area to be covered, the type of mapping units, the scale of map to be produced, type of data to be used, type of landslides, availability of resources, capability and skill set of an evaluator and the accessibility to the study area.

The currently most effective approach uses polynomial reasoning over pseudo boolean polynomials. In this approach a word-level specification is reduced by a Gröbner basis which is implied by the gate-level representation of the circuit. This reduction returns zero if and only if the circuit is correct. We give a rigorous formalization of this approach including soundness and completeness arguments. Furthermore we present a novel incremental column-wise technique to verify gate-level multipliers. This approach is further improved by extracting full- and half-adder constraints in the circuit which allows to rewrite and reduce the Gröbner basis. We also present a new technical theorem which allows to rewrite local parts of the Gröbner basis. Optimizing the Gröbner basis reduces computation time substantially. In addition we extend these algebraic techniques to verify the equivalence of bit-level multipliers without using a word-level specification. Our experiments show that regular multipliers can be verified efficiently by using off-the-shelf computer algebra tools, while more complex and optimized multipliers require more sophisticated techniques. We discuss in detail our complete verification approach including all optimizations. © 2019, The Author(s).",Arithmetic circuit verification; Computer algebra; Gröbner basis,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062781947

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 65 questionnaires were distributed to predominantly Korean logistics companies/shippers with experience in TSR and 19 replies were received. The majority of the respondents are senior executives with at least 10 years of work experience. To identify the factors and present strategies, this study applied the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities -fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method, which is based on complex multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) that facilitates decision-makers in considering an operational strategy by calculating the importance of input factors. Findings: Results from the FAHP indicate that the Strengths is the main factor affecting TSR multimodal transport decisions, followed by the Threats, Opportunities and Weakness factors. In terms of rank, reduction of transportation distance and time are determined as the most crucial factor from the perspective of Korean logistics companies, followed by the northern logistics development plan, the Russian Government's willingness to the development plan, political instability and possible linkages with the Korean ports. Originality/value: Through a hybrid MCDM analysis of Korean logistics companies, three operational strategies were proposed: foreign direct and small investments in the Russian Far East, Korean logistics companies implementing a cold-chain logistics service in the fishery industry and a government-led “Block Train Integration System” to secure the minimum threshold volume of cargo for small and medium-sized companies. © 2020, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.",Multimodal transport; Northern logistics; South Korea; TSR,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086468395

Although some apartments in Australia have adopted shared microgrid configurations to offset grid consumption, the characteristics and load patterns of CP are rarely discussed due to lack of available data. As common areas normally constitute part of owner corporations, energy distribution in these premises requires attention. This paper presents empirical analysis of the CP load connected to shared solar and battery storage for three apartment complexes located in Perth Australia. Load patterns for CP over a defined dataset period were analyzed, and grid usage reduction was examined by implementing and comparing three energy allocation strategies based on surplus energy utilization. The findings indicated significant grid usage reduction for CP load in different apartments after implementation of three strategies. Instantaneous consumption decreased 72%, and surplus allocation strategy reduced 91%, while consumption-based allocation reduced 76%, of grid electricity. Moreover, consumption-based allocation offered improved cost benefits compared to the other two strategies. The results further revealed the usefulness of energy allocation and effectiveness of surplus energy utilization. Based on outcomes, the strategies provide consolidation with conventional energy trading mechanisms and broadly link to the virtual power plant concept for coordinating energy flows between multiple generators. © 2020 by the authors.

These uncertain factors will exacerbate the frequency fluctuations of PVG integrated multi-area interconnected power systems. For such system, this paper proposes a load frequency control (LFC) strategy based on double equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) controllers. The PVG linear model and the multi-area interconnected power system linear model were established, respectively, and the disturbances were caused by grid voltage fluctuations in PVG subsystem and PV output power fluctuation and load change in multi-area interconnected power system. In PVG subsystems and multi-area interconnected power systems, two EID controllers add differently estimated equivalent system disturbances, which has the same effect as the actual disturbance, to the input channel to compensate for the impact of actual disturbances. The simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink show that the frequency deviation range of the proposed double EID method is 6% of FA-PI method and 7% of conventional PI method, respectively, when the grid voltage fluctuation and load disturbance exist. The double EID method can better compensate for the effects of external disturbances, suppress frequency fluctuations, and make the system more stable. © 2020 by the authors.

To achieve the aims, a methodological framework is proposed through a literature review, expert inputs, and a decision-aid tool, namely the grey-based digraph-matrix method. A total of 10 types of negative impacts and 22 strategic measures to tackle the impacts were identified based on the literature review and expert inputs. Then, the grey-based digraph-matrix was applied for modeling the strategic measures based on their influence to deal with the impacts. Findings reveal that the strategies “manufacturing flexibility”, “diversify the source of supply”, and “develop backup suppliers” have significant positive consequences for managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the RMG supply chain. The findings help industrial managers recover from supply chain disruptions by identifying and classifying the impacts and strategies required to manage the major supply chain disturbances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, a substantial number of such online communities have failed due to lack of participation of members. Therefore, it is critical to understand how to design a sustainable community that fulfills members’ needs and elicits active participation of members. In this literature review, we adopted a sociological framework to investigate how to create a sustainable online community. This framework suggests that the sustainability of a community comes from individual members’ three types of commitments: instrumental, affective, and moral commitments. Such commitments are results of members’ cognitive, cathectic, and evaluative processes and lead to membership retainment, cohesive relationships, and socially regulated participation. Using this framework, we conducted a systematic literature review on online teacher community articles published from 1990 to 2018. Our findings provide insights on factors associated with teacher members’ instrumental, affective, and moral commitment to an online community.

Well-being in urban environments has been studied extensively, yet most research focuses on one aspect of well-being rather than multiple dimensions of well-being. Existing well-being indices that are used to compare well-being between different countries or to set a standards for well-being consider a variety of aspects that affect well-being, yet they are not specific to urban environments. When considering that no holistic and comprehensive research has been specifically conducted on well-being in urban environments, we research the relationship between the built features of an urban environment and well-being. In this paper, we propose a Well-Being Index composed of five urban indicators—Community Connectedness, Safety & Security, Physical Health, Mental Health, and Diversity—which are each described by a set of urban attributes that enhance well-being. Each attribute is quantified using a calculation formula. In addition to quantifying well-being, the Well-Being Index emphasizes specific urban features that urban planners should consider for future decision-making. We apply the Well-Being Index to predict well-being in Boston, Massachusetts, and Kansas City, Missouri, and we speculate that Boston has higher levels of well-being in terms of the city’s urban features. Based on our results, we provide suggestions for future choices in urban planning and design to improve the areas of well-being that we were able to identify with the Well-Being Index. We emphasize that the Well-Being Index can be applied to any city in the world, and can inform future decision-making for building urban environments through the CityScope platform; a novel methodology of interaction and collaboration by using a data-driven platform that simulates the impacts of interventions on urban ecosystems prior to detail-design and execution. © 2020 by the authors.

Moreover, the current health crisis is going to force governments to review the structure of the public budget to most effectively alleviate the negative economic and health effects on the population. Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the relative importance of globalization and the public budget composition—specifically the participation of public expenditure on healthcare, social services and environment in gross domestic product (GDP)—on life expectancy at birth in European countries during the period 1995–2017. Methods: The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) methodology was applied to analyze the socioeconomic determinants of life expectancy at birth. Results: Our findings show that globalization has no relative importance as an explanatory variable of life expectancy in European countries, while government expenditure on social protection is the most relevant followed by public expenditure on health, gross national income per capita, education level of the population and public expenditure on environmental protection. Conclusion: European strategies intended to impact on health outcome should spend more attention to the composition of public budget. © 2020 by the authors.

As Nepal has experienced extensive changes due to natural and anthropogenic activities, monitoring such changes are crucial for understanding relationships and interactions between social and natural phenomena and to promote better decision-making. The main novelty lies in applying the XGBoost classifier for LC mapping over Nepal and monitoring the decadal changes of LC using ELMs. To map the LC change, a yearly cloud-free composite Landsat image was selected for the year 2010 and 2020. Combining the annual normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference built-up index and modified normalized difference water index, with elevation and slope data from shuttle radar topography mission, supervised classification was performed using a random forest and extreme gradient boosting ELMs. Post classification change detection, validation and accuracy assessment were executed after the preparation of the LC maps. Three evaluation indices, namely overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient, and F1 score from confusion matrix reports, were calculated for all the points used for validation purposes. We have obtained an OA of 0.8792 and 0.875 for RF and 0.8926 and 0.8603 for XGBoost at the 95% confidence level for 2010 and 2020 LC maps, which are better for mountainous terrain.

Virtually everyone is now familiar with the term Sustainable Development, from states to multinational corporations, and from affluent communities in the Global North to impoverished communities in the Global South. It received a new lease of life in 2015 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is recognized that sustainable development requires an inter-disciplinary, multi-level, and bottom-up approach, and that this ideal is easy to state but difficult to operationalize. Pursuant to deliberations at an international workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison1, which aimed at fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse experts and developing solutions for effective inclusion of women and youth in climate change response strategies, we propose an innovative, practical three-dimensional model that enhances sustainability theory and practice with cross-cutting integration of human rights, gender equity, and Indigenous and local knowledge. We evaluate the utility of the model in two ways: First, we analyze how the model informs current approaches to environmental sustainability and human wellbeing including the SDGs, agroecology, de-growth principles, and planetary health metrics. Then, we explore the feasibility and added value of the approach through seven case studies from Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Peru, Côte D’Ivoire, and Aotearoa – New Zealand. We conclude that the proposed model is congruent with current theory and practice. It builds on existing principles by identifying and addressing gaps. It enables practical action in a variety of settings and fosters a more integrated approach to sustainable wellbeing for humanity and our earth.

This paper proposes an approach that can be used to identify parabolic targets with different sizes and underground soil or concrete structure voids based on you only look once (YOLO) v3. With the TensorFlow 1.13.0 developed by Google, we construct YOLO v3 neural network to realize real-time pattern recognition of GPR images. We propose the specific coding method for the GPR image samples in Yolo V3 to improve the prediction accuracy of bounding boxes. At the same time, K-means algorithm is also applied to select anchor boxes to improve the accuracy of positioning hyperbolic vertex. For some instances electromagnetic-vacillated signals may occur, which refers to multiple parabolic electromagnetic waves formed by strong conductive objects among soils or overlapping waveforms. This paper deals with the vacillating signal similarity intersection over union (IoU) (V-IoU) methods. Experimental result shows that the V-IoU combined with non-maximum suppression (NMS) can accurately frame targets in GPR image and reduce the misidentified boxes as well. Compared with the single shot multi-box detector (SSD), YOLO v2, and Faster-RCNN, the V-IoU YOLO v3 shows its superior performance even when implemented by CPU. It can meet the real-time output requirements by an average 12 fps detected speed. In summary, this paper proposes a simple and high-precision real-time pattern recognition method for GPR imagery, and promoted the application of artificial intelligence or deep learning in the field of the geophysical science. © 2020 by the authors.

Typically, the pathologist’s goal is to classify the staining slides and differentiate normal from abnormal tissue. In the present study, we used a computational approach to classify images and features of benign and malignant tissues using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Here, we introduce two lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and an ensemble machine learning (EML) method for image and feature classification, respectively. Moreover, the classification using pre-trained models and handcrafted features was carried out for comparative analysis. The binary classification was performed to classify between the two grade groups (benign vs. malignant) and quantile-quantile plots were used to show their predicted outcomes. Our proposed models for deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) classification achieved promising accuracies of 94.0% and 92.0%, respectively, based on non-handcrafted features extracted from CNN layers. Therefore, these models were able to predict nearly perfectly accurately using few trainable parameters or CNN layers, highlighting the importance of DL and ML techniques and suggesting that the computational analysis of microscopic anatomy will be essential to the future practice of pathology. © 2020 by the authors.

Although widely used, supervised classification mapping requires a large number of field samples, and is consequently costly in terms of time and money. In order to reduce the need for sample size, this paper proposes an unsupervised classification method based on principal components isometric binning (PCIB). In particular, principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction is applied to the classification features, followed by the division of the top k principal components into equidistant bins. Bins of the same category are subsequently merged as a class label. Multitemporal Gaofen 1 satellite (GF-1) remote sensing images were collected over the southwest of Hulin City and Luobei County of Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, China in order to map crop types in 2016 and 2017. Our proposed method was compared with commonly used classifiers (random forest, K-means and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm (ISODATA)). Results demonstrate PCIB and random forest to have the highest classification accuracies, reaching 82% in 2016 in the southwest of Hulin City. In Luobei County in 2016, the accuracies of PCIB and random forest were determined as 81% and 82%, respectively. It can be concluded that the overall accuracy of our proposed method meets the basic requirements of classification accuracy. Despite exhibiting a lower accuracy than that of random forest, PCIB does not require a large field sample size, thus making it more suitable for large-scale crop mapping. © 2020 by the authors.

Among the different directives of IMO, currently especially the sulphur emission regulations pose challenges for the shipping industry. Related to this are the established Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and the introduced global sulphur cap. To comply with the sulphur restrictions, according to the present technological state of the art, ship-owners have three options for their existing fleet: the installation of emission abatement technologies, the switch to low sulphur fuels, or retrofitting for the usage of alternative fuels. Regardless which option is favoured, most often selected solutions still depend on fossil fuels. The reasons for this can be traced back to the fact that supply of biofuels is not ensured in ports and generally seen as no profitable solution. This paper develops and examines an innovative business model with a special focus on liquefied biogas (LBG). The study bases on collected qualitative and quantitative data, which was used by applying the Business Model Canvas. The results will highlight that the business model bears the potential to promote LBG supply. Next to this, the research will show that blockchain and smart contracts are able to foster the implementation of the business model and optimisation of value chain operations.

First, a novel generic mathematical definition of Energy Efficiency (EE) is proposed, which takes the acquisition rate of valid data, the total energy consumption, and the network lifetime of WSNs into consideration simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the EE of WSNs is mathematically defined. The energy consumption characteristics of each individual sensor node and the whole network are expounded at length. Accordingly, the concepts concerning EE, namely the Energy-Efficient Means, the Energy-Efficient Tier, and the Energy-Efficient Perspective, are proposed. Subsequently, the relevant energy-efficient strategies proposed from 2002 to 2019 are tracked and reviewed. Specifically, they respectively are classified into five categories: The Energy-Efficient Media Access Control protocol, the Mobile Node Assistance Scheme, the Energy-Efficient Clustering Scheme, the Energy-Efficient Routing Scheme, and the Compressive Sensing-based Scheme. A detailed elaboration on both of the basic principle and the evolution of them is made. Finally, further analysis on the categories is made and the related conclusion is drawn. To be specific, the interdependence among them, the relationships between each of them, and the Energy-Efficient Means, the Energy-Efficient Tier, and the Energy-Efficient Perspective are analyzed in detail.

Recognition of the determinants of dyslexic users' motivation to use e-learning systems is important to help developers improve the design of e-learning systems and educators direct their efforts to relevant factors to enhance dyslexic students' motivation. Existing research has rarely attempted to model dyslexic users' motivation in e-learning context from a comprehensive perspective. The present work has conceived a hybrid approach, namely, combining the strengths of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, to motivation modeling. It examines a variety of factors that affect dyslexic students' motivation to engage in e-learning systems from psychological, behavioral, and technical perspectives, and establishes their interrelationships. Specifically, the study collects data from a multi-item Likert-style questionnaire to measure relevant factors for conceptual motivation modeling. It then applies both covariance-based (CB-SEM) and variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approaches to determine the quantitative mapping between dyslexic students' continued use intention and motivational factors, followed by discussions about theoretical findings and design instructions according to our motivation model. Our research has led to a novel motivation model with new constructs of Learning Experience, Reading Experience, Perceived Control, and Perceived Privacy.

The self-healing capabilities of SG allow the peers to become active partakers in ESN. In general, the SG is intended to replace the fossil fuel-rich conventional grid with the distributed energy resources (DER) and pools numerous existing and emerging know-hows like information and digital communications technologies together to manage countless operations. With this, the SG will able to ""detect, react, and pro-act"" to changes in usage and address multiple issues, thereby ensuring timely grid operations. However, the ""detect, react, and pro-act"" features in DER-based SG can only be accomplished at the fullest level with the use of technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the Blockchain (BC). The techniques associated with AI include fuzzy logic, knowledge-based systems, and neural networks. They have brought advances in controlling DER-based SG. The IoT and BC have also enabled various services like data sensing, data storage, secured, transparent, and traceable digital transactions among ESN peers and its clusters. These promising technologies have gone through fast technological evolution in the past decade, and their applications have increased rapidly in ESN. Hence, this study discusses the SG and applications of AI, IoT, and BC. First, a comprehensive survey of the DER, power electronics components and their control, electric vehicles (EVs) as load components, and communication and cybersecurity issues are carried out. Second, the role played by AI-based analytics, IoT components along with energy internet architecture, and the BC assistance in improving SG services are thoroughly discussed.

However, mapping of debris-covered glaciers in alpine regions is still challenging due to many factors including the spectral similarity between debris and the adjacent bedrock, shadows cast from mountains and clouds, and seasonal snow cover. Considering that few studies have added movement velocity features when extracting glacier boundaries, we innovatively developed an automatic algorithm consisting of rule-based image segmentation and Random Forest to extract information about debris-covered glaciers with Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data for spectral, texture and temperature features, multi-digital elevation models (DEMs) for elevation and topographic features, and the Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) for movement velocity features, and accuracy evaluation was performed to determine the optimal feature combination extraction of debris-covered glaciers. The study found that the overall accuracy of extracting debris-covered glaciers using combined movement velocity features is 97.60%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.9624, which is better than the extraction results using other schemes. The high classification accuracy obtained using our method overcomes most of the above-mentioned challenges and can detect debris-covered glaciers, illustrating that this method can be executed efficiently, which will further help water resources management. © 2020 by the authors.

While there are many ways of addressing these problems, one of the innovative techniques is the recent employment of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) which include rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS). Therefore, this paper reviews the design and component of two types of RWHS, the namely roof harvesting system (RHS) and the pond harvesting system (PHS). The performance in terms of quantity and quality of collected rainwater and energy consumption for RWHS with different capacities were evaluated, as well as the benefits and challenges particularly in environmental, economic and social aspects. Presently, the RHS is more commonly applied but its effectiveness is limited by its small scale. The PHS is of larger scale and has greater potentials and effectiveness as an alternative water supply system. Results also indicate the many advantages of the PHS especially in terms of economics, environmental aspects and volume of water harvested. While the RHS may be suited to individual or existing buildings, the PHS has greater potentials and should be applied in newly developed urban areas with wet equatorial climate. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular, we improve the continuous-post operator by performing computations in high-dimensional state space only for time intervals relevant for the subsequent application of the discrete-post operator. Furthermore, the new discrete-post operator performs low-dimensional computations by leveraging the structure of the guard and assignment of a considered transition.

We relied on the word embedding to realize the contextual association that may occur between API functions in malware sequences. Our empirical results proved that there is a considerable distinction between malware and goodware call sequences. Based on that distinction, we propose a new method to detect malware that relies on the Markov chain. We also propose a heuristic method that identifies malware’s mimicry activities by tracking the likelihood behavior of a given API call sequence. Experimental results showed that our proposed model outperforms other peer models that rely on API call sequences.

This review includes 85 related articles published between 2000 and 2019. Through a thematic analysis, smart city risks were categorized into three main themes: organizational, social, and technological. The risks within the intersections of these themes were also grouped into (1) digital transformation, (2) socio-technical, and (3) corporate social responsibility. The results revealed that risk is a comparatively new topic in smart-city research and that little focus has been given to social risks. The findings indicated that studies from countries with a long history of smart cities tend to place greater emphasis on social risks.

Traditionally, anthropometric features, including the average length of each body part and average height, have been utilized for this kind of classification. Average values are generally calculated for all frames because the length of body parts and the subject height vary over time, as a result of the inaccuracy in pose estimation. Thus, traditionally, anthropometric features are measured over a long period. In contrast, we controlled the window used to measure anthropometric features over short/mid/long-term periods. This approach enables our proposed ensemble model to obtain robust and accurate BMI classification results. To produce final results, the proposed ensemble model utilizes multiple k-nearest neighbor classifiers trained using anthropometric features measured over several different time periods. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we evaluated it using a public dataset. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with benchmark methods. © 2020 by the authors.

An increase in using private cars does not meet the global sustainability goals, e.g., reducing energy consumption and improving the air quality. Road users should be encouraged to use sustainable mobility modes, particularly public transportation, equally accessible to both men and women However, women’s mobility has been somewhat limited and challenged in spatio-temporal terms, and partly due to socio-cultural barriers. This study attempts to understand the gender experience of a sample of public transport users and consider their aspirations and needs into daily mobility. A survey campaign (structured interviews and online questionnaires) was launched in the Dammam Metropolitan Region (DMR), taking four different types of respondents into account. The results suggest a predominant preference for taxis for shopping and leisure activities due to a poor public transport service, pivotally characterized by limited operational routes, hours, and infrastructure. This study ponders upon the adequacy of the supporting infrastructures and interior design of the public buses to women’s needs and compare them with global best practices. The results suggest that, due to the absence of a gender-responsive design and infrastructure, women are forced to use taxis, although privacy and a sense of insecurity often become concerns when traveling alone or with children.

In this review, we summarize recent updates on the use of TACE for HCC. TACE can be performed using two techniques; conventional TACE (cTACE) and drug-eluting beads using TACE (DEB-TACE). The anti-tumor effect of the two has been reported to be similar; however, DEB-TACE carries a higher risk of hepatic artery and biliary injuries and a relatively lower risk of post-procedural pain than cTACE. TACE can be used for early stage HCC if other curative treatments are not feasible or as a neoadjuvant treatment before liver transplantation.. TACE can also be considered for selected patients with limited portal vein thrombosis and preserved liver function. When deciding to repeat TACE, the ART (Assessment for Retreatment with TACE) score and ABCR (AFP, BCLC, Child-Pugh, and Response) score can guide the decision process, and TACE refractoriness needs to be considered. Studies on the combination therapy of TACE with other treatment modalities, such as local ablation, radiation therapy, or systemic therapy, have been actively conducted and are still ongoing. Recently, new prognostic models, including analysis of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, radiomics, and deep learning, have been developed to help predict survival after TACE. © 2020 by the authors.

However, in existing slope-unit-based landslide susceptibility assessment methods, landslide size has not been explicitly considered. This paper developed a novel slope-unit based approach for landslide susceptibility assessment that explicitly incorporates landslide size. This novel approach integrates the predicted occurrence probability (spatial probability) of landslides and predicted size (area) of potential landslides for a slope-unit to obtain a landslide susceptibility value for that slope-unit. The results of a case study showed that, from a quantitative point of view, integrating spatial probability and size in slope-unit-based landslide susceptibility assessment can bring remarkable increases of AUC (Area under the ROC curve) values. For slope-unit-based scenarios using the logistic regression method and the neural network method, the average increase of AUC brought by incorporating landslide size is up to 0.0627 and 0.0606, respectively. Slope-unit-based landslide susceptibility models incorporating landslide size had utilized the spatial extent information of historical landslides, which was dropped in models not incorporating landslide size, and therefore can make potential improvements. Nevertheless, additional case studies are still needed to further evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the densely distributed ground observations of Rs are usually insufficient to meet the increasing demand of the climate diagnosis and analysis well, so it is essential to build a long-term accurate Rs dataset. The extremely randomized trees (ERT) algorithm was used to generate Rs using routine meteorological observations (2000–2015) from the Climate Data Center of the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CDC/CMA). The estimated Rs values were validated against ground measurements at the national scale with an overall correlation coefficient value of 0.97, a mean bias of 0.04 Wm?2, a root-mean-square-error value of 23.12 Wm?2, and a mean relative error of 9.81%. It indicates that the estimated Rs from the ERT-based model is reasonably accurate. Moreover, the ERT-based model was used to generate a new daily Rs dataset at 756 CDC/CMA stations from 1958 to 2015. The long-term variation trends of Rs at 454 stations covering 46 consecutive years (1970–2015) were also analyzed. The Rs in China showed a significant decline trend (?1.1 Wm?2 per decade) during 1970–2015. A decreasing trend (?2.8 Wm?2 per decade) in Rs during 1970–1992 was observed, followed by a recovery trend (0.23 Wm?2 per decade) during 1992–2015. The recovery trends at individual stations were found at 233 out of 454 stations during 1970–2015, which were mainly located in southern and northern China. The new Rs dataset would substantially provide basic data for the related studies in agriculture, ecology, and meteorology. © 2020 by the authors.

In fact, for most of these Chinese fossils, generally categorized as ‘archaic Homo sapiens’ or ‘post-H. erectus Homo’, the taxonomic attribution is a matter of contention. With the help of ?CT techniques and a deformation-based 3D geometric morphometric approach, we focused on the morphological variation in the enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) of 18 upper and lower premolars from Chinese Middle Pleistocene hominins. We then compared our results with a number of fossil and modern human groups, including Early Pleistocene H. erectus from Sangiran; late Early Pleistocene hominins from Tighenif, Algeria; classic Neanderthals; and modern humans. Our results highlight an evolutionary/chronological trend of crown base reduction, elevation of EDJ topography, and EDJ surface simplification in the hominin groups studied here. Moreover, this study brings insights to the taxonomy/phylogeny of 6 late Middle Pleistocene specimens whose evolutionary placement has been debated for decades. Among these specimens, Changyang premolars show features that can be aligned with the Asian H. erectus hypodigm, whereas Panxian Dadong and Tongzi premolars are more similar to Late Pleistocene Homo. Compared with early to mid-Middle Pleistocene hominins in East Asia, late Middle Pleistocene hominins evince an enlarged morphological variation. A persistence of archaic morphotypes and possible admixture among populations during the late Middle Pleistocene are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Archaic Homo sapiens; Denisovan; East Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Late Middle Pleistocene; Microcomputed tomography; Premolar,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092250358

Crop type classification and a disease early warning system are some of these remote sensing applications that provide precise, timely, and cost-effective information at different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. To our knowledge, most disease surveillance systems focus on a single-sensor based solutions and lagging the integration of multiple information sources. Moreover, monitoring larger landscapes using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are challenging, and, therefore combining high resolution satellite imagery data with advanced machine learning (ML) models through the use of mobile apps could help detect and classify banana plants and provide more information on its overall health status. In this study, we classified banana under mixed-complex African landscapes through pixel-based classifications and ML models derived from multi-level satellite images (Sentinel 2, PlanetScope and WorldView-2) and UAV (MicaSense RedEdge) platforms. Our pixel-based classification from random forest (RF) model using combined features of vegetation indices (VIs) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed up to 97% overall accuracy (OA) with less than 10% omission and commission errors (OE and CE) and Kappa coefficient of 0.96 in high resolution multispectral images. We used UAV-RGB aerial images from DR Congo and Republic of Benin fields to develop a mixed-model system combining object detection model (RetinaNet) and a custom classifier for simultaneous banana localization and disease classification. Their accuracies were tested using different performance metrics. Our UAV-RGB mixed-model revealed that the developed object detection and classification model successfully classified healthy and diseased plants with 99.4%, 92.8%, 93.3% and 90.8% accuracy for the four classes: banana bunchy top disease (BBTD), Xanthomonas Wilt of Banana (BXW), healthy banana cluster and individual banana plants, respectively. These approaches of aerial image-based ML models have high potential to provide a decision support system for major banana diseases in Africa. © 2020 The Author(s)",Artificial Intelligence; Banana detection; Deep learning; Disease detection; High-resolution satellite image; Surveillance; UAV images,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091042749

Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger. There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought, it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies, researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring. Challenges related to data life cycle such as data challenges, data processing challenges and data infrastructure management challenges are also discussed. Finally, we conclude that big data analytic can be beneficial in drought monitoring but there is a need for statistical and artificial intelligence-based approaches. © 2020",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Drought monitoring; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Statistical approach,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090328146

This has resulted in an urgent need to study the motivations which enhance consumers’ proclivity to purchase food items produced organically. The current research attempts to understand potential associations between motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic), attitude, and buying behaviour towards organic food. Self-determination theory (SDT) was applied to develop a theoretically grounded framework which was evaluated with 378 organic food consumers. The hypotheses were tested by analyzing the data through structural equation modelling (SEM), wherein environmental concerns and trust were the moderating variables. The study results demonstrate the significant influence of intrinsic motivation, integrated and external regulation on consumer attitude, and buying behaviour. But, attitude had no significant association with buying behaviour. The findings indicate consumers’ motivation may be stimulated to encourage higher frequencies of purchasing organic food by emphasizing values that reflect motivations arising from ethical or green consumerism, health, and social benefits. Furthermore, policymakers should focus on avenues to integrate organic food as permanent parts of individual lives and a socially exalting behavioral action. © 2020 The Authors",Buying behaviour; Environmental concerns; OOrganic food; Self-determination theory; Trust,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089841275

In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events – especially in the future climate – this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. © 2020 The Authors",Machine learning; Rainfall threshold; Shenzhen city; Urban pluvial flooding,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089211220

Blockchain works over the principle of distributed, secured, and shared ledger, which is used to record, and track data within a decentralized network. This technology has successfully replaced certain systems of economic transactions in organizations and has the potential to overtake various industrial business models in future. Blockchain works over peer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any trusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The information stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized network and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the beginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is increasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions regarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy of blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential privacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In this article, we cover the topic of integration of differential privacy in each layer of blockchain and in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we highlight some future challenges and application scenarios in which integration of differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Blockchain; Differential privacy; Privacy preservation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087330875

Based on the difference in behavior of dative/genitive objects of ditransitives and monadic transitives in the two periods of Greek which correlates with a range of systematic alternations in the case realization of Modern Greek IO arguments depending on the presence and category (DP vs. PP) of lower theme arguments, we argue that there are two distinct modes of dative and genitive objective case assignment: they are either prepositional or dependent (structural) cases, as also proposed by Baker and Vinokurova (2010), and Baker (2015) on the basis of cross-linguistic evidence. If we adopt this proposal a number of important implications follow both for the syntax of Modern Greek genitive indirect objects and for the understanding of the change from Classical to Standard Modern Greek which must be seen as a development from a grammatical system where dative and genitive were lexical/inherent/prepositional cases to a system where genitive is a dependent case assigned to DPs in the sense of Marantz (1991). Interestingly, the development from Classical Greek (CG) to Modern Greek (MG) affected the availability of dative/genitive-nominative alternations in passivization, in the opposite direction of what might be expected, i.e. such alternations were possible in CG and are no longer possible in MG. Our paper addresses this puzzle and argues that the availability of such alternations is not always a diagnostic tool for detecting whether an indirect object DP bears lexically specified or structural/dependent Case, contra standard practice in the literature. © 2020, The Author(s).",Accusative; Dative; Dependent Case; Genitive; Greek; Inherent Case; Passivization; Prepositions,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082703840

However, issues such as data security and privacy affect cloud environments. Thus, a variety of security technologies are required, one of them is security technology using CP-ABE. Research into the CP-ABE scheme is currently ongoing, but the existing CP-ABE schemes can pose security threats and are inefficient. In terms of security, the CP-ABE approach should be secure against user collusion attacks and masquerade attacks. In addition, in a dynamic cloud environment where users are frequently added or removed, they must eliminate user access when they leave, and so users will not be able to access the cloud after removal. A user who has left should not be able to access the cloud with the existing attributes, secret key that had been granted. In addition, the existing CP-ABE scheme increases the size of the ciphertext according to the number of attributes specified by the data owner. This leads to inefficient use of cloud storage space and increases the amount of operations carried out by the user, which becomes excessive when the number of attributes is large. In this paper, CP-ABE access control is proposed to block access of withdrawn users in dynamic cloud environments. This proposed scheme focuses on the revocation of the attributes of the withdrawn users and the output of a ciphertext of a constant-size, and improves the efficiency of the user decryption operation through outsourcing.

Findings: While the original activity-based costing (ABC) model has evolved and broadened and has generated new related concepts, studies suggest that it is not as successful as accounting concepts such as the balanced scorecard. The overall popularity trajectory of activity-based thinking can be considered to be negative, and it is currently not receiving much attention in accounting journals. Research limitations/implications: This paper is based on desk research and is limited by a reliance on secondary sources. In addition, it may be subject to the authors’ own biases when it comes to defining relevant articles studied. Practical implications: This paper provides more insight into the evolution and popularity of activity-based thinking and discusses some of the reasons why it is not more widely used in practice. Originality/value: Although many studies have examined the diffusion of ABC-related techniques, most are quite dated. More than 30 years have passed since the coining of the ABC term, and the time is ripe to provide a historical re-examination of the impact of this type of thinking in the field of accounting and to consider the latest developments and trends. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Activity-based thinking; Emergence; Evolution; Management accounting innovation; Management fashion; Trajectory,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089529251

To predict solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation (SPVG) for a specific hour, this paper proposes the combination of a two-step neural network bi directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) model with an artificial neural network (ANN) model using exponential moving average (EMA) preprocessing. In this study, four types of historical input data are used: hourly PV generation for one week (168 h) ahead, hourly horizontal radiation, hourly ambient temperature, and hourly device (surface) temperature, downloaded from the Korea Open Data Portal. The first strategy is employed using the LSTM prediction model, which forecasts the SPVG of the desired time through the data from the previous week, which is preprocessed to smooth the dynamic SPVG using the EMA approach. The SPVG was predicted using the LSTM model according to the trend of the previous time-series data. However, slight errors still occur because the weather condition of the time is not reflected at the desired time. Therefore, we proposed a second strategy of an ANN model for more accurate estimation to compensate for this slight error using the four inputs predicted by the LSTM model. As a result, the LSTM prediction model with the ANN estimation model using EMA preprocessing exhibited higher accuracy in performance than other options for SPVG. © 2020 by the authors.

The concept of aging at work comes from the urgent requirement to help the aging workforce of the contemporary industries to maintain productivity while achieving a work and private life balance. While there is plenty of research focusing on the aging population, current research activities on policies covering the concept of aging at work are limited and conceptually different. This paper aims to review publications on aging at work, which could lead to the creation of a framework that targets governmental decision-makers, the non-governmental sector, the private sector, and all of those who are responsible for the formulation of policies on aging at work. In August 2019 we searched for peer-reviewed articles in English that were indexed in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Springer and published between 2008 and 2019. The keywords included the following phrases: “successful aging at work”, “active aging at work”, “healthy aging at work”, “productive aging at work”, and “older adults at work”. A total of 47,330 publications were found through database searching, and 25,187 publications were screened. Afterwards, 7756 screened publications were excluded from the further analysis, and a total of 17,431 article abstracts were evaluated for inclusion. Finally, further qualitative analysis included 1375 articles, of which about 24 are discussed in this article. The most prominent works suggest policies that encourage life-long learning, and a workforce that comprises both younger and older workers, as well as gradual retirement. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to international initiatives such as Washington and Seoul accords, outcome-based education has gained significant interest from industry, academia, governments, accreditation bodies and students. Outcome-based education is a paradigm shift form conventional education approach and its successful adoption requires sustainable quality practices by higher education institutions. Fostering quality assurance processes for outcome-based education requires careful planning and active collaboration among stakeholders. However, due to the sparse body of knowledge about quality processes in outcome-based education, many academic institutions rely on ad hoc practices, resulting in a trial and error approach. In this paper, we present set of guidelines which can help academic institutions to deploy sustainable practices in their academic programs. We document important guidelines to deliver outcome-based education based on our longitudinal work of ABET accreditation process of three different computing programs (Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, and Cyber Security and Digital Forensics).

The planning of COCZs plays a strategic leading and rigid control role in the sustainable development of parks, and the planning implementation effectiveness evaluation has been a key to the sustainable development of COCZs. From the perspective of sustainable development, we established a rating system depending on the deconstruction “effectiveness = efficiency + effect + benefit + capacity” to measure the planning implementation effectiveness evaluation indexes of COCZs, and conducted empirical research based on the evidence of Longjiang Industrial Park, Vietnam. The research results show that Longjiang Industrial Park has a good planning implementation effectiveness with remarkable comprehensive economic, social, ecological and political benefits. It features a good efficiency, effect and benefit from an excellent production capacity, reflected in the consistency between spatial planning and implementation results and a high satisfaction with planning implementation. However, planning implementation is also faced with problems such as the lag of time, imbalance between profit and loss, uneven achievement of goals, and lack of a refined planning control system. To make COCZs more sustainable in development and planning, the suggestion is, on the one hand, to accelerate the establishment of a regular and institutionalized mechanism for the planning preparation and implementation evaluation of COCZs, and bring sustainable development into the management requirements, and, on the other hand, to promote the transformation of COCZs planning from “Function and Scale Orientation” to “Quality and Effectiveness Orientation”, and guide the creation of a model for sustainable development and the planning of COCZs. © 2020 by the authors.

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite improved object recognition technologies, Pashto’s hand-written character recognition (PHCR) remains largely unsolved due to the presence of many enigmatic hand-written characters, enormously cursive Pashto characters, and lack of research attention. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for recognition of Pashto hand-written characters for the first time in an unrestricted environment. Firstly, a novel Pashto handwritten character data set, “Poha”, for 44 characters is constructed. For preprocessing, deep fusion image processing techniques and noise reduction for text optimization are applied. A CNN model optimized in the number of convolutional layers and their parameters outperformed common deep models in terms of accuracy. Moreover, a set of benchmark popular CNN models applied to Poha is evaluated and compared with the proposed model. The obtained experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to other models with test accuracy of 99.64 percent for PHCR. The results indicate that our model may be a strong candidate for handwritten character recognition and automated PHCR applications. © 2020 by the authors.

In contrast to the neural machine translation, audio–visual speech recognition (AVSR) may provide improved performance by learning the correlation between audio and visual modalities. As a result that the audio has richer information than the video related to lips, AVSR is hard to train attentions with balanced modalities. In order to increase the role of visual modality to a level of audio modality by fully exploiting input information in learning attentions, we propose a dual cross-modality (DCM) attention scheme that utilizes both an audio context vector using video query and a video context vector using audio query. Furthermore, we introduce a connectionist-temporal-classification (CTC) loss in combination with our attention-based model to force monotonic alignments required in AVSR. Recognition experiments on LRS2-BBC and LRS3-TED datasets showed that the proposed model with the DCM attention scheme and the hybrid CTC/attention architecture achieved at least a relative improvement of 7.3% on average in the word error rate (WER) compared to competing methods based on the transformer model. © 2020 by the authors.

HPIL is a novel system approach based on the textural pattern of OML and OPMDs (anomalous regions) to diffierentiate them from standard regions of the oral cavity by using autofluorescence imaging. An innovative method based on pre-processing, e.g., the Deriche–Canny edge detector and circular Hough transform (CHT); a post-processing textural analysis approach using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM); and a feature selection algorithm (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)), followed by k-nearest neighbor (KNN) to classify OPMDs and the standard region, is proposed in this paper. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in differentiating between standard and anomalous regions of the oral cavity are 83%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. The performance evaluation was plotted through the receiver operating characteristics of periodontist diagnosis with the HPIL system and without the system.

Connected vehicles (CVs) can provide enabling technologies to realize these requirements and have attracted widespread attentions from both academia and industry. These requirements ask for a well-designed computing architecture to support the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of CV applications. Computation offloading techniques, such as cloud, edge, and fog computing, can help CVs process computation-intensive and large-scale computing tasks. Additionally, different cloud/edge/fog computing architectures are suitable for supporting different types of CV applications with highly different QoS requirements, which demonstrates the importance of the computing architecture design.

Female students, students with high reading interest, students with well-educated mothers, students with parents earning more than seven million rupiahs (equals to USD480/month) were reported to have a higher textbook discourse readability. These findings suggest the importance of considering students’ individual characteristics and family socio-economic background in writing a textbook and designing reading instructions in junior high schools. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

However, it is crucial to review a RHESSys updating history, pros, and cons for further improving the RHESSys and promoting ecohydrological studies. This paper reviewed the progress of ecohydrological studies employing RHESSys by a bibliometric analysis that quantitatively analyzed the characteristics of relevant studies. In addition, we addressed the main application progress, parameter calibration and validation methods, and uncertainty analysis. We found that since its release in 1993, RHESSys has been widely applied for basins (&lt;100 km2) within mainly seven biomes. The RHESSys model has been applied for evaluating the ecohydrological responses to climate change, land management, urbanization, and disturbances, as well as water quality and biogeochemical cycle. While most studies have paid their attention on climate change, the focus has shifted to the application for land management in recent years. This study also identified many challenges in RHESSys such as the inaccessible data and parameters, oversimplified calibration approach, few applications for large-scale watersheds, and limited application fields. Therefore, this study proposed a set of suggestions to overcome the limitations and challenges: (1) Developing a new approach for parameter acquisition and calibration from multi-source data, (2) improving the applicability for a large-scale basin, and (3) extending the scope of application fields. We believe RHESSys can improve the understandings of human–environment relationships and the promotion of sustainable watersheds development. © 2020 by the authors.

This study created machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of inflow into the Soyang River Dam in South Korea, using weather and dam inflow data for 40 years. A total of six algorithms were used, as follows: decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), recurrent neural network–long short-term memory (RNN–LSTM), and convolutional neural network–LSTM (CNN–LSTM). Among these models, the multilayer perceptron model showed the best results in predicting dam inflow, with the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) value of 0.812, root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 77.218 m3 /s, mean absolute error (MAE) of 29.034 m3 /s, correlation coefficient (R) of 0.924, and determination coefficient (R2 ) of 0.817. However, when the amount of dam inflow is below 100 m3 /s, the ensemble models (random forest and gradient boosting models) performed better than MLP for the prediction of dam inflow. Therefore, two combined machine learning (CombML) models (RF_MLP and GB_MLP) were developed for the prediction of the dam inflow using the ensemble methods (RF and GB) at precipitation below 16 mm, and the MLP at precipitation above 16 mm. The precipitation of 16 mm is the average daily precipitation at the inflow of 100 m3 /s or more. The results show the accuracy verification results of NSE 0.857, RMSE 68.417 m3 /s, MAE 18.063 m3 /s, R 0.927, and R2 0.859 in RF_MLP, and NSE 0.829, RMSE 73.918 m3 /s, MAE 18.093 m3 /s, R 0.912, and R2 0.831 in GB_MLP, which infers that the combination of the models predicts the dam inflow the most accurately. CombML algorithms showed that it is possible to predict inflow through inflow learning, considering flow characteristics such as flow regimes, by combining several machine learning algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

Over the past 50 years, Equatorial Asia has experienced significant land-use change and urbanization, which have contributed to more intense and frequent extreme PM concentrations associated with increased anthropogenic and wildfire emissions. Recent advances in remote sensing instrumentation and retrieval protocols have enabled effective monitoring of PM from space in near real time with almost global coverage. In this study, long-term satellite-based observations of key chemical and physical parameters, integrated with ground-based concentrations of PM with aerodynamic diameter <10 ?m (PM10) measured at 52 stations, are used to develop a machine learning approach for continuous PM10 monitoring. As PM atmospheric pollution, like most of environmental processes, is highly non-linear and influenced by numerous variables, machine learning approaches seem very suitable. Herein, deep neural networks are developed and tested over different temporal scales and used to map PM10 over Equatorial Asia during the period 2005-2015. The proposed model captures both PM10 seasonal variability and the occurrence of extreme episodes, which are found to impact air quality on the regional scale. The modeled annual mean fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations are used to estimate long-term premature mortality. This study indicates that the region is experiencing increasing mortality rates related to long-term exposure to PM2.5, with 150 000 (108 000-193 000) premature deaths in 2005 and 204 000 (145 000-260 000) in 2015. This is mostly due to air quality worsening and high population growth in urban areas, although the contribution of years of intense wildfires results as well significant. © 2020 The Author(s).

As the scope of this research, this current study focuses on determining consumers’ purchase decisions regarding green products using a survey conducted in a fast-growing developing country. This research was descriptive and considered a conceptual framework for extending the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which was selected as the primary theoretical model. The significant contributions and main objectives of this study are as follows—to explore the present scenario of green marketing in Bangladesh with previous studies, and to fill a research gap regarding green purchase decisions by applying the TPB model with adding additional constructs, such as environmental concerns, green perceived quality, and future green estimates. A range of qualitative and quantitative techniques were adopted to collect data from the target groups, where a sample of young educated Bangladeshi consumers (n = 638) was used to consider the measurement and structural models by applying a partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. The empirical findings show that consumers’ environmental concern (EC), green perceived benefits (GPB), green awareness of price (GAP), green willingness to purchase (GWP), and future estimation of green marketing (GFE) have a strong positive influence on consumer’ green purchase decision (GPD). Still, the green perceived quality (GPQ) has a negative influence on green purchase decisions (GPD). To inform consumers about green or eco-friendly products, this study provides valuable suggestions to companies, marketers, and policymakers for designing green marketing tools such as green advertising, green branding, and eco-labels. Based on these findings, it gives some managerial insights for the promotion of green products and green marketing. © 2020 by the authors.

Such urban development potentially threatens sustainability as it vastly expands to encroaching rural areas. North Cianjur has been experiencing urban expansion from its surrounding metropolitan areas of Jakarta and Bandung that leads to the formation of urban sprawl and many other environmental problems. In this case, spatial characterization based on a quantitative and objective approach is urgently needed to provide better insight into the development of the mega-urban region’s suburb. This study proposed a quantitative and objective approach which was developed based on a quantitative zoning method. This study aims to characterize the region affected by urban expansion and urban form dynamics in North Cianjur using spatial clustering and spatial metrics approaches. The results showed that North Cianjur has four different zones consisting of two urban zones, a peri-urban zone, and a rural zone. Furthermore, the dynamics of urban forms in North Cianjur showed a trend of a more compact form in the urban zones while outside the urban zones it has become more sprawled and dispersed. This implies that spatial planning policies are incapable of containing and managing the massive expansion forces which were coming from Jakarta metropolitan, Bandung metropolitan, as well as Cianjur urban zones itself. Thus, the quantitative zoning method could enhance spatial planning, as different zones of urban–rural typology and urban from in the mega-urban suburb can be defined as a base for developing more specific effort in managing land-use changes. This approach could be adopted by other regions which have similar characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.

When the sediment delta approaches the dam, further concerns arise regarding sediments passing through turbine intakes, blades abrasion due to increased silt/sand concentration, choking of outlets, and dam safety. Thus, slowing down the delta advance rate is a worthy goal from a dam manager’s viewpoint. These problems can be solved through a flexible reservoir operation strategy that prioritize sediment deposition further away from the dam face. As a case study, the Mangla Reservoir in Pakistan is selected to elaborate the operational strategy. The methodology rests upon usage of a 1D sediment transport model to quantify the impact of different reservoir operating strategies on sedimentation. Further, in order to assess the long-term effect of a changing climate, a global climate model under representative concentration pathways scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 for the 21st century is used. The reduction of uncertainty in the suspended sediments concentration is achieved by employing an artificial neural networking technique. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis focused on estimating the impact of various parameters on sediment transport modelling was conducted. The results show that a gradual increase in the reservoir minimum operating level slows down the delta movement rate and the bed level close to the dam. However, it may compromise the downstream irrigation demand during periods of high water demand. The findings may help the reservoir managers to improve the reservoir operation rules and ultimately support the objective of a sustainable reservoir use for the societal benefit. © 2020 by the authors.

Many serious accidents have occurred worldwide over the years in mining. Although there have been efforts to create a safer work environment for miners, the number of accidents occurring at the mining sites is still significant. Machine learning techniques and predictive analytics are becoming one of the leading resources to create safer work environments in the manufacturing and construction industries. These techniques are leveraged to generate actionable insights to improve decision-making. A large amount of mining safety-related data are available, and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the data. The use of machine learning techniques can significantly benefit the mining industry. Decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural networks were implemented to analyze the outcomes of mining accidents. These machine learning models were also used to predict days away from work. An accidents dataset provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration was used to train the models. The models were trained separately on tabular data and narratives. The use of a synthetic data augmentation technique using word embedding was also investigated to tackle the data imbalance problem. Performance of all the models was compared with the performance of the traditional logistic regression model. The results show that models trained on narratives performed better than the models trained on structured/tabular data in predicting the outcome of the accident. The higher predictive power of the models trained on narratives led to the conclusion that the narratives have additional information relevant to the outcome of injury compared to the tabular entries. The models trained on tabular data had a lower mean squared error compared to the models trained on narratives while predicting the days away from work. The results highlight the importance of predictors, like shift start time, accident time, and mining experience in predicting the days away from work. It was found that the F1 score of all the underrepresented classes except one improved after the use of the data augmentation technique. This approach gave greater insight into the factors influencing the outcome of the accident and days away from work. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the pesticide droplet drift caused by wind may decrease the pesticide spraying efficiency and pollute the environment. A precision spraying system based on an airborne meteorological monitoring platform on manned agricultural aircrafts is not adaptable for. So far, there is no better solution for controlling droplet drift outside the target area caused by wind, especially by wind gusts. In this regard, a UAV trajectory adjustment system based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for pesticide drift control was proposed in this research. By collecting data from ground WSN, the UAV utilizes the wind speed and wind direction as inputs to autonomously adjust its trajectory for keeping droplet deposition in the target spraying area. Two optimized algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning and particle swarm optimization, were applied to generate the newly modified flight route. At the same time, a simplified pesticide droplet drift model that includes wind speed and wind direction as parameters was developed and adopted to simulate and compute the drift distance of pesticide droplets. Moreover, an LSTM-based wind speed prediction model and a RNN-based wind direction prediction model were established, so as to address the problem of missing the latest wind data caused by communication latency or a lack of connection with the ground nodes. Finally, experiments were carried out to test the communication latency between UAV and ground WSN, and to evaluate the proposed scheme with embedded Raspberry Pi boards in UAV for feasibility verification. Results show that the WSN-assisted UAV trajectory adjustment system is capable of providing a better performance of on-target droplet deposition for real time pesticide spraying with UAV. © 2020 by the authors.

The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology.

Furthermore, it examines the moderating effects that significant variables, such as the audience member’s age, sex or self-perception of level as a player may exert on this relationship. The results reveal that the three types of motivations are positively associated with use of the platform, although notable differences appear, with informational motivations outweighing entertainment and social motivations.

Conversely, the influence of informational motivations on the use of these platforms is moderated by the self-perception of level as a player. © 2020 by the authors.

We present a prototype system — Annapurna— which is composed of three key components: (a) a smartwatch-based gesture recognizer that can robustly identify eating-specific gestures occurring anywhere, (b) a smartwatch-based image captor that obtains a small set of relevant images (containing views of the food being consumed) with a low energy overhead, and (c) a server-based image filtering engine that removes irrelevant uploaded images. Through lessons learnt from multiple user studies, we refine Annapurna progressively and show that our vision is indeed achievable: Annapurna can identify eating episodes and capture food images (involving a very wide diversity in food content, eating styles and environments) in over 95% of all free-living eating episodes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Automated eating tracking system; Food journaling; IMU and camera data processing; Mobile computing; Wearable Sensing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090557975

This study forwards a novel residential energy stress mitigation framework called REST to estimate warming climate-induced energy stress in residential buildings using a GIS-driven urban heat island and energy modelling approach. REST further estimates rooftop solar potential to enable solar photo-voltaic (PV) based decentralised energy solutions and establish an optimised routine for peer-to-peer energy sharing at a neighbourhood scale. The optimised network is classified through a decision tree algorithm to derive sustainability rules for mitigating energy stress at an urban planning scale. These sustainability rules established distributive energy justice variables in urban planning context. The REST framework is applied as a proof-of-concept on a future smart city of India, named Amaravati. Results show that cooling energy stress can be reduced by 80 % in the study area through sensitive use of planning variables like Floor Space Index (FSI) and built-up density.

Dust storms can adversely impact both human health and the environment, but they also impact transportation infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, occasionally severely. The identification of the locations that are the primary sources of dust, especially in arid and semi-arid environments, remains a challenge as these sites are often in remote or data-scarce regions. In this study, a new method using state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms – random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) – was evaluated for its ability to spatially model the distribution of dust-source potential in eastern Iran. To accomplish this, empirically identified dust-source locations were determined with the ozone monitoring instrument aerosol index and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue aerosol optical thickness methods. The identified areas were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Measurements of the conditioning factors (lithology, wind speed, maximum air temperature, land use, slope angle, soil, rainfall, and land cover) were compiled for the study area and predictive models were developed. The area-under-the-receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and true-skill statistics (TSS) were used to validate the maps of the models' predictions. The results show that the RF algorithm performed best (AUC = 89.4% and TSS = 0.751), followed by the SVM (AUC = 87.5%, TSS = 0.73) and the MARS algorithm (AUC = 81%, TSS = 0.69). The results of the RF indicated that wind speed and land cover are the most important factors affecting dust generation. The region of highest dust-source potential that was identified by the RF is in the eastern parts of the study region. This model can be applied to other arid and semi-arid environments that experience dust storms to promote management that prevents desertification and reduces dust production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Dust storm; GIS; Iran; Modelling; Remote sensing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086066602

The present study was aimed to map rangeland degradation in a critical mountainous rangeland ecosystem of Iran. The study was carried out based on seven years intensive fieldwork and recording 1147 locations with downward trends in the quality of the rangelands. Twelve conditional factors and two important ensemble algorithms including Probability density-Index of entropy (PD-IOE) and Frequency ratio-Index of entropy (FR-IOE), were used to produce rangeland downward trend (RDT) susceptibility maps. The results of validation showed that PD-IOE hybrid model with area under curve (AUC = 0.901) and standard error (SE = 0.011) is more accurate than FR-IOE hybrid model (AUC = 0.881 and SE = 0.012). In addition, our results indicate that altitude, distance to river, and distance to road are the most important factors for rangeland degradation. In addition, the places with higher altitude and less distance to roads and rivers endured more degradation and these places have downward trends. Based on the achieved results, 2% and 10% of study area fall into the very high and high classes of downward trends, respectively. Overgrazing and early grazing are two main drivers for rangeland degradation in the study area, and the rangeland managers and decision makers should define and develop strategies to reduce pressure on rangelands and promote strategies to restore these important ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Ensemble modeling; Land degradation; Rangeland trend; Spatial mapping,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086065346

Successfully predicting falls could be of great help, yet this requires a timely and accurate fall risk assessment. Gait abnormalities are one of the best predictive signs of underlying locomotion conditions and precursors of falls. The advent of wearable sensors and wrist?worn devices provides new opportunities for continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of gait during daily activities, including the identification of unexpected changes in gait. To this end, we present in this paper a novel method for determining gait abnormalities based on a wrist?worn device and a deep neural network. It integrates convolutional and bidirectional long short?term memory layers for successful learning of spatiotemporal features from multiple sensor signals. The proposed method was evaluated using data from 18 subjects, who recorded their normal gait and simulated abnormal gait while wearing impairment glasses. The data consist of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor signals obtained from smartwatches that the subjects wore on both wrists. Numerous experiments showed that the proposed method provides better results than the compared methods, achieving 88.9% accuracy, 90.6% sensitivity, and 86.2% specificity in the detection of abnormal walking patterns using data from an accelerometer, gyroscope, and rotation vector sensor. These results indicate that reliable fall risk assessment is possible based on the detection of walking abnormalities with the use of wearable sensors on a wrist. © 2020 by the authors.

Climate change and water resource shortages may result in decreases in rice yields and possible food shortage crises. In this study, water-saving farming management was tested, and IOT field water level monitoring was used to regulate water inflow automatically. Plant height (PH) is an important phenotype to be used to determine difference in rice growth periods and yields using water-saving irrigation. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an RGB camera captured sequential images of rice fields to estimate rice PH compared with PH measured on site for estimating rice growth stages. The test results, with two crop harvests in 2019, revealed that with adequate image calibration, the correlation coefficient between UAV-PH and field-PH was higher than 0.98, indicating that UAV images can accurately determine rice PH in the field and rice growth phase.

Electricity consumption in the global south is rising as nations in the region strive for economic development.

In this paper, we take Myanmar as a case study for which photovoltaic (PV) is seen as the preferred technology owing to its modular nature and Myanmar’s tremendous PV potential. To create sustainable systems, the impact of diurnal PV profiles on electricity demand profiles needs investigating. Accurate load forecasts lead to significant savings in operation and planning and maintenance. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can easily be used for load profile forecasting. This work proposes a three-stage systematic approach which could be employed by global south countries for designing ANN load forecasting models with the aim of simplifying the design process.

Energy system models help to understand the process and to define either target systems or policy measures. Insights derived from the social sciences are not sufficiently represented in energy system models, but address crucial aspects of the transformation process. It is, therefore, necessary to develop approaches to integrate results from social science studies into energy system models. Hence, as a result of an interdisciplinary discourse among energy system modellers, social scientists, psychologists, economists and political scientists, this article explains which aspects should be considered in the models, how the respective results can be collected and which aspects of integration into energy system models are conceivable to provide an overview for other modellers. As a result of the discourse, five facets are examined: Investment behaviour (market acceptance), user behaviour, local acceptance, technology innovation and socio-political acceptance. Finally, an approach is presented that introduces a compound of energy system models (with a focus on the macro and micro-perspective) as well as submodels on technology genesis and socio-political acceptance, which serves to gain a more fundamental knowledge of the transformation process. © 2020 by the authors.

To this end, a comprehensive database of literature reviews was searched. The results of the SGB model were more satisfactory than the other models. Furthermore, an analysis was done to determine the outlying bad data points. It showed that most of the experimental data points were located in a reliable zone for the development of the model. The mean squared error and R2 were 0.00249 and 0.987, 0.0132 and 0.9434, 0.0320 and 0.8754, and 0.0201 and 0.9204 for the SGB, MLP-ANN, ANFIS, and RBF-ANN, respectively. According to this study, the ability of SGB for estimating the Cp of ionanofluids was shown to be greater than other models. By eliminating the need for conducting costly and time-consuming experiments, the SGB strategy showed its superiority compared with experimental measurements. Furthermore, the SGB displayed great generalizability because of the stochastic element. Therefore, it can be highly applicable to unseen conditions. Furthermore, it can help chemical engineers and chemists by providing a model with low parameters that yields satisfactory results for estimating the Cp of ionanofluids. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis showed that Cp is directly related to T, Mw, and Tc, and has an inverse relation with ? and x. Mw and Tc had the highest impact and ? had the lowest impact on Cp. © 2020 by the authors.",Heat capacity; Ionic liquid; Nanofluid; Particle swarm optimization; Soft computing models,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091934759

Although several world energy outlooks have suggested that the renewable resources available worldwide are sufficient to satisfy global energy needs in multiples of thousands, the different challenges often associated with practical exploitation have made this assertion an illusion to date. Thus, more research efforts are required to synthesize the nature of these challenges as well as viable solution strategies, hence, the need for this review study. First, brief overviews are provided for each of the studied renewable energy sources. Next, challenges and solution strategies associated with each of them at generation phase are discussed, with reference to power grid integration.

Transportation, power delivery, environmental monitoring, and medical applications are among the front runners when it comes to leveraging the benefits of IoT for improving services through modern decision support systems. Though with the enormous usage of the Internet of Medical Things, security and privacy become intrinsic issues, thus adversaries can exploit these devices or information on these devices for malicious intents. These devices generate and log large and complex raw data which are used by decision support systems to provide better care to patients. Investigation of these enormous and complicated data from a victim's device is a daunting and time-consuming task for an investigator. Different feature-based frameworks have been proposed to resolve this problem to detect early and effectively the access logs to better assess the event. But the problem with the existing approaches is that it forces the investigator to manually comb through collected data which can contain a huge amount of irrelevant data. These data are provided normally in textual form to the investigators which are too time-consuming for the investigations even if they can utilize machine learning or natural language processing techniques. In this paper, we proposed a visualization-based approach to tackle the problem of investigating large and complex raw data sets from the Internet of Medical Things. Our contribution in this work is twofold. Firstly, we create a data set through a dynamic behavioral analysis of 400 malware samples. Secondly, the resultant and reduced data set were then visualized most feasibly. This is to investigate an incident easily. The experimental results show that an investigator can investigate large amounts of data in an easy and time-efficient manner through the effective use of visualization techniques. © 2020 by the authors.",Forensics investigation; Internet of medical things; Malware; Security; Visualization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091702623

Warming climate and human expansion in fire-prone landscapes exacerbate fire impacts and call for more effective management tools. Here we developed a global fire forecasting system that predicts monthly emissions using past fire data and climate variables for lead times of 1 to 6 months. Using monthly fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) as the prediction target, we fit a statistical time series model, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with eXogenous variables (ARIMAX), in over 1,300 different fire regions. Optimized parameters were then used to forecast future emissions. The forecast system took into account information about region-specific seasonality, long-term trends, recent fire observations, and climate drivers representing both large-scale climate variability and local fire weather. We cross-validated the forecast skill of the system with different combinations of predictors and forecast lead times. The reference model, which combined endogenous and exogenous predictors with a 1 month forecast lead time, explained 52% of the variability in the global fire emissions anomaly, considerably exceeding the performance of a reference model that assumed persistent emissions during the forecast period. The system also successfully resolved detailed spatial patterns of fire emissions anomalies in regions with significant fire activity. This study bridges the gap between the efforts of near-real-time fire forecasts and seasonal fire outlooks and represents a step toward establishing an operational global fire, smoke, and carbon cycle forecasting system. ©2020.

In this line, the objective of this research is to identify significant variables generating overruns in time and cost using empirical data of 535 rural road projects in Colombia from 2015 to 2018. Bivariate analysis, with statistical tools like Spearman's Rho and Kruskal-Wallis, allowed identifying that higher values of variables like budget and project intensity are related to higher deviations in cost and time. Additionally, it was found that projects with shorter durations are reporting higher time overruns. The worst performers are projects executed in the year that council mayors start their terms, those developed in municipalities with more resources, and those awarded using a competitive bidding process. Multivariate analysis, through Random Forest, assessed the effect of considering all variables interacting simultaneously and ranking them in order of importance. The results demonstrated a relationship between cost and time performance, and that numerical variables are more significant than the categorical ones.

The current study aimed to apply multivariate analysis and to develop a simplified water quality assessment using principal component analysis (PCA) and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) technique to assess the water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The proposed methods depended on the monitored water chemical composition (e.g., pH, water electrical conductivity (ECiw), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-) during 2019. Based on the supervised classification of satellite images (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the distinguished land use/land cover types around the Bahr Mouise canal were agriculture, urban, and water bodies, while the dominating land use was agriculture. The water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal was classified into two classes based on the application of the irrigation water quality index (IWQI), while the water quality was classified into three classes using the PCA and AHC methods. Temporal variations in water quality were investigated, where the water qualities in winter, autumn, and spring (January, February, March, April, November, and December) were classified as class I (no restrictions) based on IWQI application, and the water salinity, sodicity, and/or alkalinity did not represent limiting factors for irrigation water quality. On the other hand, in the summer season (May, June, July, August, and October), the irrigation water was classified as class II (low restrictions); therefore, irrigation processes during summer may lead to an increase in the alkalinity hazard. The PCA classifications were compared with the IWQI results; the PCA classifications had similar assessment results during the year, except in September, while the water quality was assigned to class II using the PCA method and class I by applying the IWQI. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) around the Bahr Mouise canal over eight months and climatic data assisted in explaining the fluctuations in water quality during 2019 as a result of changing the crop season and agriculture management. Assessments of water quality help to conserve soil, reduce degradation risk, and support decision makers in order to obtain sustainable agriculture, especially under water irrigation scarcity and the limited agricultural land in such an arid region. © 2020 by the authors.",Arid region; IWQI; Land use; PCA; Water quality criteria,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090967617

This model was applied to predict one-hour ahead solar radiation and spatially map solar energy potential. The newly designed ConvLSTM model enabled reliable prediction of solar radiation, incorporating spatial changes in atmospheric conditions and capturing the temporal sequence-to-sequence variations that are likely to influence solar driven power supply and its overall stability. Results showed that the proposed ConvLSTM model successfully captured cloud-induced variations in ground level solar radiation when compared with reference images from a physical model. A comparison with ground pyranometer measurements indicated that the short-term prediction of global solar radiation by the proposed ConvLSTM had the highest accuracy [root mean square error (RMSE) = 83.458 W • m-2, mean bias error (MBE) = 4.466 W • m-2, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.874] when compared with results of conventional artificial neural network (ANN) [RMSE = 94.085 W • m-2, MBE =-6.039 W • m-2, R2 = 0.821] and random forest (RF) [RMSE = 95.262 W • m-2, MBE =-11.576 W • m-2, R2 = 0.839] models. In addition, ConvLSTM better captured the temporal variations in predicted solar radiation, mainly due to cloud attenuation effects when compared with two selected ground stations. The study showed that contemporaneous satellite images over short-term or near real-time intervals can successfully support solar energy exploration in areas without continuous environmental monitoring systems, where satellite footprints are available to model and monitor solar energy management systems supporting real-life power grid systems. © 2020 The Author(s).

The proposed model consists of two widely used optimization algorithms named the firefly algorithm (FA) and genetic algorithm (GA). The hybridization of two optimization approaches results in a better optimization process, leading to better performance of the process in terms of minimum power consumption and maximum occupant's comfort. The inputs of the optimization model are illumination, temperature, and air quality from the user, in addition with the external environment. The outputs of the proposed model are the optimized values of illumination, temperature, and air quality, which are, in turn, used in computing the values of user comfort. After the computation of the comfort index, these values enter the fuzzy controllers, which are used to adjust the cooling/heating system, illumination system, and ventilation system according to the occupant's requirement. A user-friendly environment for power consumption minimization and user comfort maximization using data from different sensors, user, processes, power control systems, and various actuators is proposed in this work. The results obtained from the hybrid model have been compared with many state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The final results revealed that the proposed approach performed better as compared to the standard optimization techniques. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Increases in population, and industrialization are putting more and more pressure on water resources not only in Brunei but worldwide. The management of water resources under a changing climate is of key importance. The goal of this study was to investigate if current water quality changes in Brunei can be related to climatic change. The study investigated time series data from water quality parameters as well as rainfall data measured over a 3-year period. The time series data was analysed using auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions. The results showed changes in climate evident from a decrease in precipitation and increase in rainfall intensity. These changes can be correlated with changes in water quality in particular a rise in aluminium concentrations. The highest correlation was observed between turbidity and colour, with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.8. The results from cross correlation showed that pH values tend to be low before the occurrence of rainfall, due to a dropping of water levels and the likely exposure of acid sulphate soils. Low pH values were correlated with higher aluminium concentrations which have been rising consistently throughout the observation period. The rise in aluminium concentration is correlated with a rise in abstraction from the river during the time period which underlines the importance of water management in a changing climate. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Aluminium; Brunei; Climate change; pH; Rainfall; Water quality,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090499861

Traditional prediction methods cannot capture the nonlinear and non-stationarity of water quality well. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has made them a hotspot in water quality prediction. We have conducted extensive investigation and analysis on ANN-based water quality prediction from three aspects, namely feedforward, recurrent, and hybrid architectures. Based on 151 papers published from 2008 to 2019, 23 types of water quality variables were highlighted. The variables were primarily collected by the sensor, followed by specialist experimental equipment, such as a UV-visible photometer. Five different output strategies, namely Univariate-Input-Itself-Output, Univariate-Input-Other-Output, Multivariate-Input-Other(multi)-output, Multivariate-Input-Itself-Other-Output, and Multivariate- Input-Itself-Other (multi)-Output, are summarized. From results of the review, it can be concluded that the ANN models are capable of dealing with different modeling problems in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), groundwater, ponds, and streams. The results of many of the review articles are useful to researchers in prediction and similar fields. Several new architectures presented in the study, such as recurrent and hybrid structures, are able to improve the modeling quality of future development. © 2020 by the authors.",ANNs; Feedforward; Hybrid; Recurrent; Water quality prediction,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090396797

Since the outbreak began, almost 28,000 articles about COVID-19 have been published (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); however, few have explored the role of imaging and artificial intelligence in COVID-19 patients—specifically, those with comorbidities. This paper begins by presenting the four pathways that can lead to heart and brain injuries following a COVID-19 infection. Our survey also offers insights into the role that imaging can play in the treatment of comorbid patients, based on probabilities derived from COVID-19 symptom statistics. Such symptoms include myocardial injury, hypoxia, plaque rupture, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, coronary thrombosis, encephalitis, ischemia, inflammation, and lung injury. At its core, this study considers the role of image-based AI, which can be used to characterize the tissues of a COVID-19 patient and classify the severity of their infection.

In recent years, due to the frequent occurrence of civil engineering laboratory accidents, it has become an urgent issue regarding on what factors influencing safety risks and how to assess and reduce the safety risks in civil engineering laboratories. Based on the lab criticity index (LCI) model, the research specificities of civil engineering laboratories were analyzed through literature review and expert interviews and 13 risk factors of civil engineering laboratories, from the four aspects of man, object, management, and environment, identified. The data for each parameter in the LCI model was obtained through a questionnaire survey, and finally the LCI value was calculated to evaluate priority. Among them, insufficient safety awareness of operators, danger due to equipment failure, imperfect management policies, and complex floor conditions were listed as the most common risk factors. Based on the LCI model, the worsening factors of these four risk factors were further analyzed. The LCI model is applied to the new research field of safety risk assessment in civil engineering laboratories that few researchers have studied before and a risk list for civil engineering laboratories was created. We revealed the safety status of civil engineering laboratories in Jiangsu Province and provided feasible suggestions for improving the management and supervision of civil engineering laboratories at universities. It can strengthen operator awareness of the risks in civil engineering laboratories and improve the social group’s attention to the safety risks of the laboratories, thus reducing the accidents’ possibility and seriousness of civil engineering laboratories. © 2020 by the authors.

However, rarely have research studies discussed the spatiotemporal pattern of this change and related influencing factors at city-scale across the nation. In this research, the clustering patterns of the decline rates of PM2.5 and PM10 during the period from January 20 to April 8 in 2020, compared with the same period of 2019, were investigated using spatial autocorrelation analysis. Four meteorological factors and two socioeconomic factors, i.e., the decline of intra-city mobility intensity (dIMI) representing the effect of traffic mobility and the decline rates of the secondary industrial output values (drSIOV), were adopted in the regression analysis. Then, multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), a model allowing the particular processing scale for each independent variable, was applied for investigating the relationship between PM pollution reductions and influencing factors. For comparison, ordinary least square (OLS) regression and the classic geographically weighted regression (GWR) were also performed. The research found that there were 16% and 20% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration across China and significant PM pollution mitigation in central, east, and south regions of China. As for the regression analysis results, MGWR outperformed the other two models, with R2 of 0.711 and 0.732 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The results of MGWR revealed that the two socioeconomic factors had more significant impacts than meteorological factors. It showed that the reduction of traffic mobility caused more relative declines of PM2.5 in east China (e.g., cities in Jiangsu), while it caused more relative declines of PM10 in central China (e.g., cities in Henan). The reduction of industrial operation had a strong relationship with the PM10 drop in northeast China. The results are crucial for understanding how the decline pattern of PM pollution varied spatially during the COVID-19 outbreak, and it also provides a good reference for air pollution control in the future. © 2020, MDPI AG.

However, CC and edge computing have security challenges, including vulnerability for clients and association acknowledgment, that delay the rapid adoption of computing models.

Firstly, through principal component analysis (PCA) and iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA) of historical driving data, a typical driving cycle which can describe driving characteristics of the driver is constructed. Then offline optimization of control parameters by adaptive simulated annealing under each typical driving cycle and online recognition of driving cycles by extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied to the adaptive multi-workpoints energy management strategy (A-MEMS) of E-REV.

Side-channel attacks (SCAs) are powerful cryptanalysis techniques that focus on the underlying implementation of cryptographic ciphers during execution rather than attacking the structure of cryptographic functions. This paper reviews cache-based software side-channel attacks, mitigation and detection techniques that target various cryptosystems, particularly RSA, proposed over the last decade (2007–2018). It provides a detailed taxonomy of attacks on RSA cryptosystems and discusses their strengths and weaknesses while attacking different algorithmic implementations of RSA. A threat model is presented based on the cache features that are being leveraged for such attacks across cache hierarchy in computing architectures. The paper also provides a classification of these attacks based on the source of information leakage. It then undertakes a qualitative analysis of secret key retrieval efficiency, complexity, and the features being exploited on target cryptosystems in these attacks. The paper also discusses the mitigation and detection techniques proposed against such attacks and classifies them based on their effectiveness at various levels in caching hardware and leveraged features.

The fast and significant evolution of CPS affects various aspects in people's way of life and enables a wider range of services and applications including e-Health, smart homes, e-Commerce, etc. However, interconnecting the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to new dangerous security challenges. Consequently, CPS security has attracted the attention of both researchers and industries. This paper surveys the main aspects of CPS and the corresponding applications, technologies, and standards. Moreover, CPS security vulnerabilities, threats and attacks are reviewed, while the key issues and challenges are identified. Additionally, the existing security measures are presented and analyzed while identifying their main limitations. Finally, several suggestions and recommendations are proposed benefiting from the lessons learned throughout this comprehensive review. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",attacks and issues; Cyber-physical systems; Cyber-physical vulnerabilities and challenges; Cyber-security threats; privacy and forensics solutions; Security; Security and performance analysis,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088227031

To put into practice the notion of ‘use without abuse’, it is vital for national park managers to be cognizant of tourists' attitudes and beliefs, which in turn affect their behaviours. This study evaluates the attitudes of domestic and international tourists regarding the appropriate uses of national parks, as well as their environmental concerns. The study also addresses the relationship between environmental concerns and tourists' perceptions of the appropriateness of activities, facilities and services inside national parks. A total of 379 domestic (n = 175) and international (n = 204) tourists participated in this study at Taman Negara (national park), Malaysia. The findings reveal that domestic tourists perceive motorised activities, accommodation and service facilities, and sport/recreation facilities as more acceptable than international tourists do. The results of this study may help managers of protected areas in Malaysia and other developing countries play a stronger role in improving visitors' awareness of environmental challenges and acceptable behaviours and activities. Management implications: This study reinforces established ideas for national park and protected area management: • Tourists' environmental concerns can negatively affect their attitudes towards the appropriateness of activities, facilities, and accommodations within national parks. • The attitudes of various groups of visitors regarding human uses of national parks vary between different cultural backgrounds. • To reduce the impact of tourism activities on the natural environment and minimising the environmental degradation of protected areas, decision-makers should incorporate into their management plans the environmental concerns and attitudes of visitors who use protected areas and national parks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Appropriate use; Ecotourism; Environmental concerns; National parks; Protected areas; Tourist attitudes,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087981709

First, we present an overview of smart city developments with a critical focus on corporatization and platform urbanism. We critique Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs development in Toronto, which faces public backlash from the #BlockSidewalk campaign in response to concerns over not just privacy, but also lack of community consultation, the prospect of the city losing its civic ability to self-govern, and its repossession of public land and infrastructure. Second, we explore what a more responsible smart city could look like, underpinned by technological sovereignty, which is a way to use technologies to promote individual and collective autonomy and empowerment via ownership, control, and self-governance of data and technologies. To this end, we juxtapose the Sidewalk Labs development in Toronto with the Barcelona Digital City plan.

With nearly 4000 publications, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is clearly one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models worldwide. The model has been widely used for projecting the impacts of future hydro-climatic changes, but application for extreme streamflow conditions is still rarely reported. To date, SWAT application reviews have focused on compilations of SWAT studies for specific or relatively new applications such as eco-hydrological modelling, ecosystem services, sub-daily simulations, and pesticide fate and transport simulations. However, no existing SWAT review studies have focused on simulation of hydro-climatic extremes. Therefore, this research aims to bridge this gap by compiling and reviewing the findings of studies reporting SWAT hydro-climatic extremes including highlighting the performance and future research needs. A total of 111 articles have been identified since 1999; most of these studies were conducted in the United States and China. These articles can be divided into extreme flow assessments, drought studies, flood studies, drought and flood studies, SWAT coupling with other models, and SWAT improvements. Most of the extreme performance assessment studies reported “satisfactory” performance, with a particular emphasis on peak flow comparisons. Future research needs regarding this topic include: (1) a unified SWAT extreme performance assessment framework; (2) SWAT improvements that result in improved replication of peak and low flows; (3) reliability assessment of global and satellite products for SWAT extreme simulations; (4) bias correction of CMIP6 and regional climate projections; (5) comparison of SWAT+ and SWAT for extreme flow simulations in different types of basins; (6) development of an extreme flow module within an overall SWAT modelling system; and (7) integration of artificial intelligence within SWAT modelling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; Drought; Extreme; Flood; Peak flow; SWAT,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086799335

Actually, the use of a surrogate model such as Kriging or Artificial Neural Network allows to reduce the number of calls to the CPU time-intensive simulator. Bayesian optimization uses the ability of surrogates to provide useful information to help guiding effectively the optimization process. In this paper, the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) reference framework is challenged by a Bayesian Neural Network-assisted Genetic Algorithm, namely BNN-GA. The Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) surrogate is chosen for its ability to provide an uncertainty measure of the prediction that allows to compute the Expected Improvement of a candidate solution in order to improve the exploration of the objective space. BNN is also more reliable than Kriging models for high-dimensional problems and faster to set up thanks to its incremental training. In addition, we propose a batch-based approach for the parallelization of BNN-GA that is challenged by a parallel version of EGO, called q-EGO. Parallel computing is a highly important complementary way (to surrogates) to deal with the computational burden of simulation-based optimization. The comparison of the two parallel approaches is experimentally performed through several benchmark functions and two real-world problems within the scope of Tuberculosis Transmission Control (TBTC). The study presented in this paper proves that parallel batched BNN-GA is a viable alternative to q-EGO approaches being more suitable for high-dimensional problems, parallelization impact, bigger data-bases and moderate search budgets. Moreover, a significant improvement of the solutions is obtained for the two TBTC problems tackled. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian optimization; Efficient global optimization; Evolutionary algorithm; Massively parallel computing; Simulation; Surrogate-assisted optimization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086498430

Floods directly and indirectly damage highway systems and disturb the socioeconomic order. In this study, we propose an integrated approach to quantitatively assess how floods impact the functioning of a highway system. The approach has three parts: (1) a multi-agent simulation model to represent traffic, heterogeneous user demand, and route choice in a highway network; (2) a flood simulator using future runoff scenarios generated from five global climate models, three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and the CaMa-Flood model; and (3) an impact analyzer, which superimposes the simulated floods on the highway traffic simulation system, and quantifies the flood impact on a highway system based on car following model. This approach is illustrated with a case study of the Chinese highway network. The results show that (i) for different global climate models, the associated flood damage to a highway system is not linearly correlated with the forcing levels of RCPs, or with future years; (ii) floods in different years have variable impacts on regional connectivity; and (iii) extreme flood impacts can cause huge damages in highway networks; that is, in 2030, the estimated 84.5% of routes between provinces cannot be completed when the highway system is disturbed by a future major flood. These results have critical implications for transport sector policies and can be used to guide highway design and infrastructure protection. The approach can be extended to analyze other networks with spatial vulnerability, and it is an effective quantitative tool for reducing systemic disaster risk. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis",Flood; highway network; impact assessment; multi-agent modeling; traffic simulation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086049485

In the last years the number of bio-inspired optimization approaches in literature has grown considerably, reaching unprecedented levels that dark the future prospects of this field of research. This paper addresses this problem by proposing two comprehensive, principle-based taxonomies that allow researchers to organize existing and future algorithmic developments into well-defined categories, considering two different criteria: the source of inspiration and the behavior of each algorithm. Using these taxonomies we review more than three hundred publications dealing with nature-inspired and bio-inspired algorithms, and proposals falling within each of these categories are examined, leading to a critical summary of design trends and similarities between them, and the identification of the most similar classical algorithm for each reviewed paper. From our analysis we conclude that a poor relationship is often found between the natural inspiration of an algorithm and its behavior. Furthermore, similarities in terms of behavior between different algorithms are greater than what is claimed in their public disclosure: specifically, we show that more than one-third of the reviewed bio-inspired solvers are versions of classical algorithms. Grounded on the conclusions of our critical analysis, we give several recommendations and points of improvement for better methodological practices in this active and growing research field. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bio-inspired optimization; Classification; Nature-inspired algorithms; Taxonomy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084340371

Due to the time-varying nature of resource demands in length and processing over time and dynamics and heterogeneity of cloud resources, existing myopic task scheduling solutions intended to maximize the performance of task scheduling are inefficient and sacrifice the long-time system performance in terms of resource utilization and response time. In this paper, we propose an optimal solution for performing foresighted task scheduling in a cloud environment. Since a-priori knowledge from the dynamics in queue length of virtual machines is not known in run time, an online reinforcement learning approach is proposed for foresighted task allocation. The evaluation results show that our method not only reduce the response time and makespan of submitted tasks, but also increase the resource efficiency. So in this thesis a scheduling method based on reinforcement learning is proposed. Adopting with environment conditions and responding to unsteady requests, reinforcement learning can cause a long-term increase in system’s performance. The results show that this proposed method can not only reduce the response time and makespan but also increase resource efficiency as a minor goal. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cloud computing; Reinforcement learning; Response time; Task scheduling,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084155757

Design/methodology/approach: The deviations of countries' results from what could be expected, considering their relative wealth is calculated by using the residuals of a linear regression using the Gross Domestic Product per capita as the independent variable and the UN E-Government Development Index as the dependent variable. The countries that achieve better and worse results than expected are then identified and their cases are analyzed by resorting to secondary sources, namely, published research referring to their cases. Those research documents were identified by successively searching the Scopus database, the Google Scholar database and the Web of Science. Findings: The existence of formal e-government strategies and plans and the capacity to implement them can make a difference, allowing countries to achieve better results than expected or, in their absence, to perform worse than expected. Research limitations/implications: The proposed methodology can be useful to e-government researchers, particularly as a basis for deeper and more detailed studies. Practical implications: Countries should invest in well-developed and focused strategies and continuity of public policies and their capacity to deliver results. For that purpose, political commitment and high-level coordination are key factors. For low-income countries, long-lasting cooperation with external experienced partners is crucial. For high-income countries, innovative thinking is a key enabler.

Various chemical parameters like total dissolved solid (TDS), arsenic (As), fluoride (F?), Iron (Fe), nitrate (NO3?), nitrite (NO2?), and pH were determined for 46,457 samples collected from 205,344 km2 area of the Punjab. The samples were collected, stored, and analyzed as per the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) methods at laboratory. Commercial kits were used for analysis of Fe, As, NO2?, NO3? and F?, while TDS and pH were measured by respective meters. Chemical parameters were correlated with human and animal population, fertilizers consumption, tube wells, industrial density, rain occurrence, and river recharge rate. Data were analyzed using XLSTAT, and GIS 10.3 was used to draw the maps. Spatial classification of the districts was performed by principal component analysis and hierarchal cluster analysis. TDS, As, F?, Fe, NO3?, NO2?, and pH were found to be 50–52,360 mg/L, 0–735 ?g/L, 0–121 mg/L, 0–37.2 mg/L, 0–2215 mg/L, 0–3033 mg/L, and 0.09–10.9, respectively. The study revealed that 66.26% of the samples were fit for drinking purpose, while 33.74% were unfit. Further, it was found that 27% of the samples were non-saline, 26% were saline, and 47% were slightly saline based on the World Health Organization drinking water quality criteria. A nonlinear model was developed which explains 57% of variance in groundwater quality. Based on groundwater quality, the whole province was divided into three main regions: northwestern districts, central districts and southeastern districts. Central Punjab was highly polluted, followed by southeast region, while northwest Punjab has better quality water due to more rains and Indus River. Current study provides a model to predict future water quality of the region and suggests that new water canals in southeast Punjab can improve water quality. Moreover, it is recommended that agriculture and industrial effluents should be controlled to improve water quality, new smart cities should be built along Indus River, and population should be controlled in southeast and central Punjab.

Based on the emotions of the public of different genders in urban space, suggestions are provided for urban planning and development from the perspective of POI (Point of Interest). The main steps are: (1) Analyzing the emotional score of Weibo texts published by citizens in the waterfront area of 21 lakes in Wuhan City; (2) exploring the public emotion characteristics of different genders in the urban waterfront; (3) classifying the waterfront according to the emotional response (score) of the public of different genders; (4) exploring the relationship between different POI types and waterfront types and proposing planning suggestions. The results of this study provide evidence for gender differences and spatial distribution of public emotions in the Wuhan waterfront area.

Although DGs offer many benefits to the distribution system, their integration affects the stability of the system, which could lead to blackout when the grid is disconnected. The system frequency will drop drastically if DG generation capacity is less than the total load demand in the network. In order to sustain the system stability, under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) is inevitable. The common approach of load shedding sheds random loads until the system's frequency is recovered. Random and sequential selection results in excessive load shedding, which in turn causes frequency overshoot. In this regard, this paper proposes an efficient load shedding technique for islanded distribution systems. This technique utilizes a voltage stability index to rank the unstable loads for load shedding. In the proposed method, the power imbalance is computed using the swing equation incorporating frequency value. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization produces optimal load shedding strategy based on the priority of the loads (i.e., non-critical, semi-critical, and critical) and the load ranking from the voltage stability index of loads. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is tested on two test systems, i.e., a 28-bus system that is a part of the Malaysian distribution network and the IEEE 69-bus system, using PSCAD/EMTDC. Results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed technique in quickly stabilizing the system's frequency without frequency overshoot by disconnecting unstable non-critical loads on priority. Furthermore, results show that the proposed technique is superior to other adaptive techniques because it increases the sustainability by reducing the load shed amount and avoiding overshoot in system frequency. © 2020 by the authors.",Cascaded blackout; Distributed generation; Frequency overshoot; Load priority; Mixed integer linear programming; Stability index of loads; Unprecedented frequency variations,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089897963

Thus, this present study aimed to extract those insights from reviews using latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised type of topic modeling that extracts latent discussion topics from text data. Findings of Hong Kong's 185,695 and Singapore's 93,571 Airbnb reviews, two long-term rival destinations, were compared. Hong Kong produced 12 total topics that can be categorized into four distinct groups whereas Singapore's optimal number of topics was only five. Topics produced from both destinations covered the same range of attributes, but Hong Kong's 12 topics provide a greater degree of precision to formulate managerial recommendations. While many topics are similar to established hotel attributes, topics related to the host and listing management are unique to the Airbnb experience. The findings also revealed keywords used when evaluating the experience that provide more insight beyond typical numeric ratings. © 2020 by the authors.",Airbnb; Automated text analysis; Hong Kong; Latent dirichlet allocation (LDA); Online reviews; Singapore,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089816079

A massive amount of spatio-temporal information has made it possible to know where a person was and when, but not how and why (s)he travelled, creating the need for inference models.

For this paper, which is the first review dedicated to inferring trip purposes from GPS data, 1162 non-duplicate papers from four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and TRID) were screened, and a corpus of 25 publications was selected for examination. Based on these papers, the purpose imputation problem is defined in the contexts of the evolution of GPS-based travel surveys and two research domains, transportation science (TS) and human geography (HG). Subsequently, three steps of the purpose detection process, namely trip end detection, input feature selection and main algorithms and validation, are surveyed. During these procedures, the differences between studies in TS and those in HG are highlighted. Finally, unresolved issues related to data and feature selection, algorithms and assessment are discussed substantially to provide potential research directions.

Deep-learning-based classification of remote-sensing images overcomes the two difficulties of traditional learning methods (e.g., support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF)) when extracting the cultivated land: (1) the limited performance when extracting the same land-cover type with the high intra-class spectral variation, such as cultivated land with both vegetation and non-vegetation cover, and (2) the limited generalization ability for handling a large dataset to apply the model to different locations. However, the “pooling” process in most deep convolutional networks, which attempts to enlarge the sensing field of the kernel by involving the upscale process, leads to significant detail loss in the output, including the edges, gradients, and image texture details. To solve this problem, in this study we proposed a new end-to-end extraction algorithm, a high-resolution U-Net (HRU-Net), to preserve the image details by improving the skip connection structure and the loss function of the original U-Net. The proposed HRU-Net was tested in Xinjiang Province, China to extract the cultivated land from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. The result showed that the HRU-Net achieved better performance (Acc: 92.81%; kappa: 0.81; F1-score: 0.90) than the U-Net++ (Acc: 91.74%; kappa: 0.79; F1-score: 0.89), the original U-Net (Acc: 89.83%; kappa: 0.74; F1-score: 0.86), and the Random Forest model (Acc: 76.13%; kappa: 0.48; F1-score: 0.69). The robustness of the proposed model for the intra-class spectral variation and the accuracy of the edge details were also compared, and this showed that the HRU-Net obtained more accurate edge details and had less influence from the intra-class spectral variation. The model proposed in this study can be further applied to other land cover types that have more spectral diversity and require more details of extraction. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper reviews the advancements in both classical (i.e. ultrasounds, X-ray, optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and more recent (i.e. multispectral, photoacoustic and Raman imaging) intra-operative imaging modalities. Each imaging modality was analyzed, focusing on benefits and disadvantages in terms of compatibility with the operating room, costs, acquisition time and image characteristics. Tables are included to summarize this information. New generation of hybrid surgical room and algorithms for real time/in room image processing were also investigated. Each imaging modality has its own (site- and procedure-specific) peculiarities in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, field of view and contrasted tissues. Besides the benefits that each technique offers for guidance, considerations about operators and patient risk, costs, and extra time required for surgical procedures have to be considered. The current trend is to equip surgical rooms with multimodal imaging systems, so as to integrate multiple information for real-time data extraction and computer-assisted processing. The future of surgery is to enhance surgeons eye to minimize intra- and after-surgery adverse events and provide surgeons with all possible support to objectify and optimize the care-delivery process. © 2020, Biomedical Engineering Society.",Image-guided surgery; Intraoperative imaging; Operating room; Review; Surgical data science,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087296027

This study proposes an improved hybrid model, named multi-feature clustering decomposition (MCD)–echo state network (ESN)–particle swarm optimization (PSO), for multi-step PM2.5 concentration forecasting. The proposed model includes decomposition and optimized forecasting components. In the decomposition component, an MCD method consisting of rough sets attribute reduction (RSAR), k-means clustering (KC), and the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is proposed for feature selection and data classification. Within the MCD, the RSAR algorithm is adopted to select significant air pollutant variables, which are then clustered by the KC algorithm. The clustered results of the PM2.5 concentration series are decomposed into several sublayers by the EWT algorithm. In the optimized forecasting component, an ESN-based predictor is built for each decomposed sublayer to complete the multi-step forecasting computation. The PSO algorithm is utilized to optimize the initial parameters of the ESN-based predictor. Real PM2.5 concentration data from four cities located in different zones in China are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed forecasting model is suitable for the multi-step high-precision forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations and has better performance than the benchmark models. © 2020 Chinese Academy of Engineering",Empirical wavelet transform; Multi-step forecasting; PM2.5 concentrations clustering; PM2.5 concentrations forecasting,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087163550

Various models exist for simulating household load profiles to cater different purposes. A macroscopic viewpoint necessitates modeling of a large-scale population at an aggregate level, whereas a microscopic perspective requires measuring loads at a granular level, pertinent to the individual devices of a household. Both aspects have lucrative benefits, instigating the need to combine them into a modeling framework which allows model scalability and flexibility, and to analyze domestic electricity consumption at different resolutions. In this applied research, we propose a multi-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) framework for estimating domestic electricity consumption. Our proposed framework simulates per minute electricity consumption by combining large neighborhoods, the behavior of household individuals, their interactions with the electrical appliances, their sociological habits and the effects of exogenous conditions such as weather and seasons. In comparison with the existing energy models, our framework uniquely provides a hierarchical, multi-scale, multi-resolution implementation using a multi-layer architecture. This allows the modelers flexibility in order to model large-scale neighborhoods at one end, without any loss of expressiveness in modeling microscopic details of individuals’ activities at house level, and energy consumption at the appliance level, at the other end. The validity of our framework is demonstrated using a case study of 264 houses. A validated ABMS framework will support: (a) Effective energy planning; (b) Estimation of the future energy demand; (c) and the analysis of the complex dynamic behavior of the consumers. © The Author(s) 2020.",Agent-based modeling and simulation; electricity appliances; electricity consumption behavior; electricity demand profiles; model validation; multi-resolution modeling; occupancy patterns; urban electricity use,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086238877

While such noisy near-term quantum computing systems fall far short of the requirements for fault-tolerant systems, they provide unique test beds for exploring the opportunities for quantum applications.

Attacks that cause misclassifications or mispredictions can lead to erroneous decisions resulting in unreliable operations. Designing robust ML with the ability to provide reliable results in the presence of such attacks has become a top priority in the field of adversarial machine learning. An essential characteristic for rapid development of robust ML is an arms race between attack and defense strategists. However, an important prerequisite for the arms race is access to a well-defined system model so that experiments can be repeated by independent researchers. This article proposes a fine-grained system-driven taxonomy to specify ML applications and adversarial system models in an unambiguous manner such that independent researchers can replicate experiments and escalate the arms race to develop more evolved and robust ML applications. The article provides taxonomies for: 1) the dataset, 2) the ML architecture, 3) the adversary's knowledge, capability, and goal, 4) adversary's strategy, and 5) the defense response. In addition, the relationships among these models and taxonomies are analyzed by proposing an adversarial machine learning cycle. The provided models and taxonomies are merged to form a comprehensive system-driven taxonomy, which represents the arms race between the ML applications and adversaries in recent years. The taxonomies encode best practices in the field and help evaluate and compare the contributions of research works and reveals gaps in the field. © 2017 IEEE.",adversarial machine learning; attack model; Computational intelligence (CI); defense model; supervised learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085754473

This paper presents an application of the Internet-of-Things for model-based evaluation of microclimate parameters inside two greenhouse crop production systems. The objectives thus were to develop (i) a comfort ratio model, and (ii) a custom-built wireless sensor for data fusion in order to evaluate and compare microclimate parameters inside two different tropical greenhouses prior to the actual cultivation of tomato. The model was implemented in MATLAB Simulink with a flexible architecture and self-tuning reference inputs to work with different crops and cultural practices within which various growth stages can be modeled and analyzed. The accuracy and functional reliability of the sensor, as well as the performance of the model were validated by collecting and analyzing microclimate data from a naturally ventilated net-covered Screenhouse and a Polycarbonate Panel greenhouse under tropical lowland climate conditions of Malaysia. Raw data including air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation were processed by the model for simulating comfort ratio values associated with different growth stages. Preliminary results showed that the mean and maximum vapor pressure deficit were respectively 1.19 and 5.1 kPa in the Polycarbonate Panel greenhouse and 0.97 and 3.81 kPa in the Screenhouse. Analyses based on comfort ratio values were validated with the results from raw data, showing that when temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit were in the range of 25 ± 5 °C, 80 ± 20%, and 1.1±1 kPa in the Screenhouse, the comfort ratio values associated with the optimum reference borders were higher than those in the Polycarbonate Panel greenhouse. This study thus suggests that comfort ratio index is a more revealing indicator for comparing two or more greenhouses based on the dynamic assessment of microclimate parameters. The proposed method takes into an account the variation in each parameter, not only with the respect to different reference borders, but also by considering different time frames, light conditions and growth stages. The presented IoT sensor node and the Simulink model provide growers with a better insight into interpreting crop growth environment. The results of this study can contribute to optimal control strategies for a more efficient greenhouse crop production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Comfort ratio; Greenhouse production; Microclimate; Simulation models; Wireless sensors,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083164925

Thus, developing RHRs with high degrees of human-likeness provides a life-like vessel for humans to physically and naturally interact with technology in a manner insurmountable to any other form of non-biological human emulation. This study outlines a human–robot interaction (HRI) experiment employing two automated RHRs with a contrasting appearance and personality. The selective sample group employed in this study is composed of 20 individuals, categorised by age and gender for a diverse statistical analysis. Galvanic skin response, facial expression analysis, and AI analytics permitted cross-analysis of biometric and AI data with participant testimonies to reify the results. This study concludes that younger test subjects preferred HRI with a younger-looking RHR and the more senior age group with an older looking RHR. Moreover, the female test group preferred HRI with an RHR with a younger appearance and male subjects with an older looking RHR.

In many cases, however, the quality of HMPs has rarely been considered regarding potential culprits such as contaminants and toxins possibly incriminated as causes for the liver injury. This review aims to comprehensively assemble details of tentative hepatotoxic contaminants and toxins found in HMPs. Based on the origin, harmful agents may be divided according two main sources, namely the phyto-hepatotoxin and the nonphyto-hepatotoxin groups. More specifically, phyto-hepatotoxins are phytochemicals or their metabolites naturally produced by plants or internally in response to plant stress conditions. In contrast, nonphyto-hepatotoxic elements may include contaminants or adulterants occurring during collection, processing and production, are the result of accumulation of toxic heavy metals by the plant itself due to soil pollutions, or represent mycotoxins, herbicidal and pesticidal residues. The phyto-hepatotoxins detected in HMPs are classified into eight major groups consisting of volatile compounds, phytotoxic proteins, glycosides, terpenoid lactones, terpenoids, alkaloids, anthraquinones, and phenolic acids. Nonphyto-hepatotoxins including metals, mycotoxins, and pesticidal and herbicidal residues and tentative mechanisms of toxicity are discussed. In conclusion, although a variety of potential toxic substances may enter the human body through HMP use, the ability of these toxins to trigger human liver injury remains largely unclear. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, an efficient multiclass objects categorization method is proposed for the indoor-outdoor scene classification of scenery images using benchmark datasets. We illustrate two improved methods, fuzzy c-mean and mean shift algorithms, which infer multiple object segmentation in complex images. Multiple object categorization is achieved through multiple kernel learning (MKL), which considers local descriptors and signatures of regions. The relations between multiple objects are then examined by intersection over union algorithm. Finally, scene classification is achieved by using Multi-class Logistic Regression (McLR). Experimental evaluation demonstrated that our scene classification method is superior compared to other conventional methods, especially when dealing with complex images. Our system should be applicable in various domains such as drone targeting, autonomous driving, Global positioning systems, robotics and tourist guide applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Oil industries are always searching for innovative drilling technologies to optimize field development process in a complex structure. Managed pressure drilling (MPD) is now becoming an attractive alternative to the traditional overbalance drilling in complex formation. MPD offered substantial benefits in terms of project economics and reduced non-productive time (NPT). These benefits are substantial in the offshore structure, where any downtime significantly impacts the project cost. MPD is designed to avoid continuous formation influx into the wellbore, and any incidental fluid is contained with a specific predetermined process. MPD used some specialized tools and techniques to enhance traditional kick detection capabilities and circulate formation influx while keeping NPT at the minimum level. Early kick detection is a primary concern for the drilling industry to ensure the safety of the drilling rig, crews, and environmental protection. This research focused on a systematic review of kick detection and mitigation in MPD operation. A review of recent advancements in MPD, various early kick detection methods, comparative study of different kick indicators with their significance, different gas kick models, and risk analysis are analyzed systemically. Several control methods in the MPD operation are summarized. A systematic comparison of different gas kick circulation methods in conventional drilling and MPD is presented in this study. Also, different alternative responses to conventional kick circulation methods are summarized. This work critically analyzed different kick responses of circulating and non-circulating methods, e.g. shut-in, modified pump shut down, increasing in casing pressure and stepwise increase in pump rate. However, all circulation methods are elementary, and no kick circulation method is universally applicable to all drilling operations. Finally, this review emphasized some recent progress and challenges in kick detection on managed pressure drilling. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Early kick detection; Kick response; MPD; Well control,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097563003

Thus, selecting a proper ML algorithm help us to understand possible future occurrences by analyzing the past more accurate. The main purpose of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility map of the Ayancik district of Sinop province, situated in the Black Sea region of Turkey using three featured regression tree-based ensemble methods including gradient boosting machines (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest (RF). Fifteen landslide causative factors and 105 landslide locations occurred in the region were used. The landslide inventory map was randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset to construct the RF, XGBoost and GBM prediction models. Symmetrical uncertainty measure was utilized to determine the most important causative factors, and then the selected features were used to construct susceptibility prediction models. The performance of the ensemble models was validated using different accuracy metrics including Area under the curve (AUC), overall accuracy (OA), Root mean square error (RMSE), and Kappa coefficient. Also, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences between optimum models. The accuracy results showed that the model of XgBoost_Opt model (the model created by optimum factor combination) has the highest prediction capability (OA = 0.8501 and AUC = 0.8976), followed by the RF_opt (OA = 0.8336 and AUC = 0.8860) and GBM_Opt (OA = 0.8244 and AUC = 0.8796). When the Wilcoxon sign-rank test results were analyzed, XgBoost_Opt model, which is the best subset combinations, were confirmed to be statistically significant considering other models. The results showed that, the XGBoost method according to optimum model achieved lower prediction error and higher accuracy results than the other ensemble methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Ensemble tree; Extreme gradient boosting; Feature selection; Machine learning; Symmetrical uncertainty,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096668611

Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, a skeleton-based person identification method using a deep neural network (DNN) is investigated. In this method, anthropometric features extracted from the human skeleton sequence are used as the input to the DNN. However, training the DNN with insufficient training datasets makes the network unstable and may lead to overfitting during the training phase, causing significant performance degradation in the testing phase. To cope with a shortage in the dataset, we investigate novel data augmentation for skeleton-based person identification by utilizing the bilateral symmetry of the human body. To achieve this, augmented vectors are generated by sharing the anthropometric features extracted from one side of the human body with the other and vice versa. Thereby, the total number of anthropometric feature vectors is increased by 256 times, which enables the DNN to be trained while avoiding overfitting. The simulation results demonstrate that the average accuracy of person identification is remarkably improved up to 100% based on the augmentation on public datasets. © 2020 by the authors.",Anthropometric feature; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Deep neural network; Human skeleton; Person identification,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088640222

This is particularly important for a remote area without a sufficient number of in-situ data, promoting the usage of remotely sensed surface variables. Direct correlation analysis between ground-observed WD and localized passive remotely-sensed surface variables (e.g., indices and geometric variables) has been studied extensively over the past two decades. Most of these related studies focused on the usage of constructed correlative relationships for estimating WD at ungauged locations. Nevertheless, temporal prediction performance of monthly runoff (R) (being an average representation of WD of a catchment) at the river delta reconstructed from the basin's upstream remotely-sensed water balance variables via a standardization approach has not been explored. This study examined the standardization approach via linear regression using the remotely-sensed water balance variables from upstream of the Mekong Basin to reconstruct and predict monthly R time series at the Mekong Delta. This was subsequently compared to that based on artificial intelligence (AI) models. Accounting for less than 1% improvement via the AI-based models over that of a direct linear regression, our results showed that both the reconstructed and predicted Rs based on the proposed approach yielded a 2-6% further improvement, in particular the reduction of discrepancy in the peak and trough of WD, over those reconstructed and predicted from the remotely-sensed water balance variables without standardization. This further indicated the advantage of the proposed standardization approach to mitigate potential environmental influences. The best R, predicted from standardized water storage over the whole upstream area, attained the highest Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.978 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.947, and the lowest normalized root-mean-square error of 0.072. © 2020 by the author.",Mekong Delta; Remote sensing hydrology; Runoff; Water balance variable standardization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088507152

These fuels are non-renewable energy sources that will eventually be exhausted. Currently, biodiesel has gained attention as a renewable green energy source and means of supporting the minimization of fossil fuel use. However, obtaining biodiesel from edible seeds has been criticized as unethical, due to the source material being needed for human consumption. In this regard, papaya seed waste could be utilized as a potential feedstock because it is non-edible and its high lipid content makes it excellent for producing biodiesel. Papaya fruit is not seasonal. It is available at all times in tropical countries, and almost 75% of the total papaya is generated in the glove. Thus, different soft computing or data mining approaches such response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector regression (SVR) can be utilized to predict oil yields from waste papaya seeds via solvent extraction. In the present research, the data for oil yields were obtained by experiments based on a central composite design. These data were then employed to develop, compare, and assess the suggested models. The results indicate that the SVR model performed much better for predicting oil yields than did the ANN and RSM models, with respect to various performance-measuring parameters (i.e., relative error, correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error). It was observed that oil yields increase with an increase in extraction time but decrease as particle size increases. In order to find the global optimal set, an SVR and crow search algorithm-based interface was implemented. A maximum oil yield of 28.55% was achieved at 6.5 h of extraction and a particle size of 0.85 mm. The predicted oil yield was validated experimentally with less than a 5% rate of error.

The primary objective of IoUT is the creation of a network of several smart interconnected undersea things, to digitally link water bodies by using devices such as autonomous underwater vehicles. Since the traditional ideas of IoT cannot be merely expanded to underwater, due to the difference in environmental characteristics, this puts forward a variety of challenges for scientists to work with IoUT, and one such challenge is the network management with IoUT. This paper gives an overview on (1) underwater network management systems (U-NMS) using acoustic communication in IoUT; (2) the challenges and benefits and use cases of U-NMS; (3) fault, configuration, accounting, performance, security and constrained management (FCAPSC) functionalities of U-NMS and (4) a comparison between network management system in IoT and U-NMS system in IoUT. Additionally, this paper shows the prototype design and implementation setup of U-NMS in a laboratory environment, using lightweight machine to machine (LWM2M) and acoustic communication technology for IoUT.

PWN is currently a quarantine object in 52 countries. In recent years, pine wilt disease has caused considerable economic losses to the pine forest production industry in China, as it is difficult to control. Thus, one of the key strategies for controlling pine wilt disease is to identify epidemic points as early as possible. The use of hyperspectral cameras mounted on drones is expected to enable PWD monitoring over large areas of forest, and hyperspectral images can reflect different stages of PWD. The trend of applying hyperspectral techniques to the monitoring of pine wilt disease is analyzed, and the corresponding strategies to address the existing technical problems are proposed, such as data collection of early warning stages, needs of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and establishment of models after preprocessing. © 2020 by the authors.

AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interests—and even their own political stability—in the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system. We argue that the prevention of malicious uses of AI and the enhancement of human welfare create strong common interests across jurisdictions that require sustained efforts to develop better, mutually beneficial approaches. We hope that new technology diplomacy will facilitate the dialogues necessary to help all interested parties develop a shared understanding and coordinate efforts to utilise AI for the benefit of humanity, a task whose difficulty should not be underestimated. © 2020 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Decentralisation; Fragmentation; Human well-being; International collaborative governance; Protectionism; Techno-nationalism; Technology diplomacy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084431211

This is because phishers are able to use similar methods to entice social network users to click on malicious links masquerading as fake news, controversial videos and other opportunities thought to be attractive or beneficial to the victim. SNSs are a phisher's “market” as they offer phishers a wide range of targets and take advantage of opportunities that exploit the behavioural vulnerabilities of their users. As such, it is important to further investigate aspects affecting behaviour when users are presented with phishing. Based on the literature studied, this research presents a theoretical model to address phishing susceptibility on SNSs. Using data collected from 215 respondents, the study examined the mediating role that information processing plays with regard to user susceptibility to social network phishing based on their personality traits, thereby identifying user characteristics that may be more susceptible than others to phishing on SNSs. The results from the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that conscientious users were found to have a negative influence on heuristic processing, and are thus less susceptible to phishing on SNSs. The study also confirmed that heuristic processing increases susceptibility to phishing, thus supporting prior studies in this area. This research contributes to the information security discipline as it is one of the first to examine the effect of the relationship between the Big Five personality model and the heuristic-systematic model of information processing. © 2020",Big Five; Heuristic processing; Heuristic-systematic processing model; Information processing; Personality traits; Phishing; Structural equation modeling; Systematic processing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084331918

The present study investigates the different consumer barriers toward the intentions to use and recommend MPSs. The current study examines the adoption and usage of MPSs through the lens of innovation resistance. We developed the research model based on the innovation resistance theory (IRT) and tested it using a large cross-sectional study with 1256 MPS users. The study findings suggest that usage, risk, and value barriers are negatively associated with intentions to use MPSs. On the other hand, only usage and value barriers have a negative association with users’ intention to recommend MPSs. In comparison, the tradition and image barriers did not share any association with the user intentions.

But it is ill defined and its habitat quality is rarely assessed insipite of its immense socio-ecological importance. The present work intends to delineate the riparian corridor and quality assessment of the riparian habitat in reference to the hydrological alteration (HA) triggered by anthropogenic activities, mainly damming in 1989. The present work applied multi-parametric (altitude, topographic roughness, water body, forest patches) approach for delineating the riparian corridor instead of existing uni-criterion approaches for the same. Quality assessment of the habitat is done using nine surface, ecological, hydrological and anthropogenic parameters in the Arc Gis platform employing advance machine learning algorithms like Fuzzy logic (FL), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Random subspace, Dagging and Support vector machine (SVM). Total 20.63 km2 and 18.36 km2 areas respectively in pre and post-HA periods alongside the main river are identified as the riparian corridor. HA has reduced the area under the riparian corridor by 12.29% in post-HA state. Simultaneously, the quality of the riparian habitat is also deteriorated in the post-HA period. In pre-HA state, 49.05% area was under good to very good riparian habitat but it is reduced to 11.86% in post-HA state. Regularization of the flood, release of ecological flow to the downstream, renovation of tie channels between flood plain and river, restriction in agricultural invasion towards riparian forest and wetland are some of the essential steps for minimizing qualitative deterioration of riparian habitat and amelioration of the ecosystem concerned. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Damming effects; Hydrological alteration; Machine learning algorithms; Riparian corridor; Riparian habitat quality assessment,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081643820

Yet scenario optimization for large-scale applications is limited by the computational expense of optimization over many control factors. In this study, a multi-pollutant cost-benefit optimization system based on a genetic algorithm (GA) in machine learning has been developed to provide cost-effective air quality control strategies for large-scale applications (e.g., solution spaces of ~1035). The method was demonstrated by providing optimal cost-benefit control pathways to attain air quality goals for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. The GA was found to be &gt;99% more efficient than the commonly used grid searching method while providing the same combination of optimized multi-pollutant control strategies. The GA method can therefore address air quality management problems that are intractable using the grid searching method. The annual attainment goals for PM2.5 (&lt; 35 ?g m?3) and O3 (&lt; 80 ppb) can be achieved simultaneously over the PRD region and surrounding areas by reducing NOx (22%), volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 12%), and primary PM (30%) emissions. However, to attain stricter PM2.5 goals, SO2 reductions (&gt; 9%) are needed as well. The estimated benefit-to-cost ratio of the optimal control strategy reached 17.7 in our application, demonstrating the value of multi-pollutant control for cost-effective air quality management in the PRD region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Air pollution control strategies; Cost-benefit analysis; Genetic algorithm; Multi-pollutant optimization; Ozone; PM2.5,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082009441

The timely estimation of domestic wheat production is highly critical to address any potential food security issues and has been identified as a priority by the Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL). In this study, we developed a system for in-season mapping of wheat crop area based on both optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR, Sentinel-1) data to support estimation of wheat cultivated area for management and food security planning. Utilizing a 2010 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) cropland mask, wheat sown area for 2017 was mapped integrating decision trees and machine learning algorithms in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Information from provincial crop calendars in addition to training and validation data from field-based surveys, and high-resolution Digitalglobe and Airbus Pleiades images were used for classification and validation. The total irrigated and rainfed wheat area were estimated as 912,525 and 562,611 ha, respectively for 2017. Province-wise accuracy assessments show the maximum accuracy of irrigated (IR) and rainfed (RF) wheat across provinces was 98.76 and 99%, respectively, whereas the minimum accuracy was found to be 48% (IR) and 73% (RF). The lower accuracy is attributed to the unavailability of reference data, cloud cover in the satellite images and overlap of spectral reflectance of wheat with other crops, especially in the opium poppy growing provinces. While the method is designed to provide estimation at different stages of the growing season, the best accuracy is achieved at the end of harvest using time-series satellite data for the whole season. The approach followed in the study can be used to generate wheat area maps for other years to aid in food security planning and policy decisions. © Copyright © 2020 Tiwari, Matin, Qamer, Ellenburg, Bajracharya, Vadrevu, Rushi and Yusafi.",crop type; GEE; random forest; sentinel 1; sentinel 2,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087306998

Starting from the traditional handmade programs for the management of these processes, during the last two decades there has been a notable increase in studies and publications in this field, trying to formulate scheduling in a rational and automatic way. The process has been approached for years through the development of both physical and operational research models, many of them theoretically. The main purpose of this study is to present a critical and in-depth evaluation of the previous studies, so that the state of the art of scheduling in steelworks can be evaluated. An approach based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been used, trying to search, evaluate, synthesize and analyze all the relevant studies for this specific field. As a result, the conclusions of the various analyses are presented and a study route is proposed for the design of the optimal planning methodology in the steelworks. © 2020 Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

This massive transfer of soil, typically imported from peri-urban and rural areas, raises questions about the environmental sustainability of such projects. It has been suggested that artificial soils made with urban wastes, also called constructed Technosols, might be a sustainable alternative. In this article, we examined during three years, different mixtures of excavated deep horizons of soil, crushed concrete and green waste compost, in order to (i) identify the most suitable mixture for growing trees; (ii) identify tolerant tree species among six different species; and (iii) assess macrofaunal colonization, a major driver of soil fertility, from the surrounding macrofaunal pool. The mixture of excavated deep horizons and green waste compost led to the highest tree mortality. The best tree survival and growth, and quickest soil macrofaunal colonization were obtained with a mixture of 20% of excavated deep horizons, 10% of green waste compost and 70% of crushed concrete (v/v). The survival rate of species Acer campestre and Prunus avium was 100% but only 58% for Carpinus betulus. Our results show the construction of Technosols with urban wastes is a promising alternative for planting trees and hosting soil biodiversity within cities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Constructed Technosol; Crushed concrete; Excavated subsoil; Green waste compost; Soil macroinvertebrates; Tree planting,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084953908

This study explored teachers' awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic and their opinion on their respective schools’ readiness, as well as their response to the challenges of conducting distance learning education in the Philippines. A validated questionnaire was developed to collect the relevant data for this study. The initial reliability test obtained 8.9 Cronbach’s alpha. Data gathering procedure was done through Google forms, which, after validation from the respective DepEd divisions and universities, were subsequently sent to the teachers via email. The results show that the teachers were highly aware of the presence and consequences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation between teacher’s demographic profiles and awareness to COVID-19 shows no relationship at all. Nevertheless, the length of teaching experience and specialization is very strongly correlated to readiness to distance learning education. Simultaneously, the teachers’ geographic location is strongly correlated to readiness to adapt to distance learning education. Furthermore, only the teachers’ gender has a significant difference in their awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, teachers’ gender, length of teaching experience, and geographic location have significant differences with their readiness to distance learning education. This study can be used as a basis for further research particularly in developing institutional plans to better understand the status of their teachers and educational organizations, and schools’ readiness to teach and learn through distance learning approach; hence, preserving and continuing educational mission during the current or future pandemic as well as be prepared for any natural disasters. ©2020 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

The innumerable potentials of the internet include instant delivery of news, multimedia content and other user-friendly features to media consumers. Since digital news consumption is proliferating in India, it is important to study how Indian regional newspapers have adapted to new media technological advancements. Using Zamith’s (2008. 9th International Symposium on Online Journalism, 1–8) methodological framework, we identify various potentials of the internet that can be utilized by the traditional media offering news online. The study examines the extent to which Indian regional news sites have incorporated these potentials—interactivity, hypertextuality, multimediality, immediacy, memory, personalization, ubiquity, creativity and other latest new media technologies. Roger Fidler’s ‘mediamorphosis theory’ is employed as a theoretical approach to examine how regional language newspapers are responding to technological advancements. The study looks at three news sites of the most circulated Kannada language (a regional language of Karnataka state) newspapers.

Knowledge and understanding of how our vision works are crucial to creating a hardware-adaptive computational model that can replicate retinal behavior. The neuronal system is nonlinear and very intricate. It is thus instrumental to have a clear view of the neurophysiological and neuroanatomic processes and to take into account the underlying principles that govern the process of hardware transformation to produce an appropriate model that can be mapped to a physical device.

These models were applied to predict monthly precipitation in the Han River basin, South Korea. Based on the lead month of forecast, 10 climate indices with high correlations were selected and combined to construct four-variable multiple regression models for monthly precipitation forecasting. The forecast results for the analytical period (2010-2019) showed that predictability was low for some summer seasons but satisfactory for other seasons and long periods. In the goodness-of-fit test results, the Nash-Sutclie eciency (0.48-0.57) and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the observation (0.66-0.72) were evaluated to be satisfactory while the percent bias (9.4-15.5%) was evaluated to be between very good and good.

Numerous civilian and commercial uses are drastically transforming civil protection, asset delivery, commercial and entertaining activities. However, UAS pose significant challenges in terms of safety, security and privacy within society. An increasing phenomenon, nowadays, is drone?related incidents near airport facilities, which are expected to proliferate in frequency, complexity and severity, as drones become larger and more powerful. Critical infrastructures need to be protected from such aerial attacks, through effective counteracting technologies, risk management and resilience plans. In this paper, we present a survey of drone incidents near airports and a literature review of sensor technologies, able to prevent, detect, identify and mitigate rogue drones. We exhibit the benefits and limitations of available counter?drone technologies (C?UAS); however, defending airports against misused drone activity is a hard problem. Therefore, we analyze three realistic attack scenarios from malicious drones and propose an effective C?UAS protection plan for each case. We discuss applicability limitations of C?UAS in the aviation context and propose a resilience action plan for airport stakeholders for defending against airborne threats from misused drones. © 2020 by the authors.

YT has become a massive marketing communication platform, which serves as a medium to target the lucrative Generation Z cohort (first born in the late 1990s), and influence this generation's infamously unpredictable purchase decision process. The main aim of this paper was to consider the effect of YouTube marketing communication (YMC) on the traditional and non-traditional attitudinal associations of response hierarchy models. A multi-stage sample technique was used and 3750 high school and college learners (aged 13-18 years old) were surveyed via self-administered questionnaires in South Africa. Structural equation modelling was utilised to consider the hypothesised attitudinal associations. The research determined that YMC had a positive influence on the hypothesised attitudinal associations, and young consumers who used YT for fewer years, logged on more frequently, spent shorter time periods on the platform, viewed higher numbers of commercials, aged 13-14 years old, and from the White population group exhibited the most positive attitudinal responses. Hence, organisations should review their strategies in order to develop more sustainable YMC owing to the heterogeneity evident among young African consumers. © 2020 by the authors.",Attitudes; Demographic variables; Developing country; Generation Z; Hierarchy-of-effects model; Social media; South Africa; Usage variables; YouTube marketing communication,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086921132

The western half of Iran has been affected by natural hazards in the recent decades. One of these natural hazards is reduced rainfall, which manifests itself in the form of drought. The effects of drought in the different parts of the human society have been strongly felt in the recent years. Therefore, it is important to address this issue. The purpose of this study is to monitor and analyze drought in the western part of Iran. To do this, the MODIS satellite data, the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), and the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Project) satellite were used from 2000 to 2018, and for better analysis, they were compared with the fuzzy index of T.I.B.I (combined index based on four indices: SET, SPI, SEB, and MCZI) neural network. To calculate the T.I.B.I index, the ground climate parameters of precipitation, temperature, sunshine, minimum relative humidity, and wind speed were used; to extract satellite data and images, Google Earth Engine was used. The results of the study indicate that drought has started to weaken in the western part of Iran since 2010, and in 2016 and in the recent years, it has reached its peak. The northern and central regions of the study area were more prone to drought than elsewhere. Approximately 69.80% of the area is subject to severe drought. In order to deal with the catastrophe caused by drought that has many dangerous effects, it requires careful planning in the future. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Drought sensitivity index; Evaporation and transpiration; Satellite meteorology; Soil moisture,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086582131

Several deduplication techniques have been designed to provide improved security or efficiency. In this study,we focus on the client-side deduplication technique,which has more advantages than the server-side deduplication technique, particularly in communication overhead, owing to conditional data transmissions. From a security perspective, poison, dictionary, and identification attacks are considered as threats against client-side deduplication. Unfortunately, in contrast to other attacks, identification attacks and the corresponding countermeasures have not been studied in depth. In identification attacks, an adversary tries to identify the existence of a specific file. Identification attacks should be countered because adversaries can use the attacks to break the privacy of the data owner. Therefore, in the literature, some counter-based countermeasures have been proposed as temporary remedies for such attacks. In this paper, we present an analysis of the security features of deduplication techniques against identification attacks and show that the lack of security of the techniques can be eliminated by providing uncertainness to the conditional responses in the deduplication protocol, which are based on the existence of files. We also present a concrete countermeasure, called the time-locked deduplication technique, which can provide uncertainness to the conditional responses by withholding the operation of the deduplication functionality until a predefined time. An additional cost for locking is incurred only when the file to be stored does not already exist in the server's storage. Therefore, our technique can improve the security of client-side deduplication against identification attacks at almost the same cost as existing techniques, except in the case of files uploaded for the first time. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors’ names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters. © 2020 by the authors.

But SWAT-MLP/WOA model has R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 1.42, NSE = 0.81 and RE=-0.09, so SWAT-MLP/ MWOA model is presented as the best model for runoff prediction. © 2020 The Authors",artificial neural network; forecasting; model calibration; Mutation watershed; Runoff; soil and water assessment tool; whale optimization algorithm,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083306453

However, due to the importance of the topic and its prominence in many applications, the information on it is scattered in various journals, conference proceedings, and patents, and lacked a focused-literature that synthesizes them in a single document. This review aims to provide an overview of the NIAs and their role in solving community detection problems. To achieve this goal, a systematic study is performed on NIAs,followed by historical and statistical analysis of the researches involved.

As such, the field of digital forensics has become far more sophisticated over the years and is now able to uncover even more evidence that can be used to support prosecution of cyber criminals in a court of law. Governments, too, have embraced the ability to track suspicious individuals in the online world. Forensics investigators are driven to gather data exhaustively, being under pressure to provide law enforcement with sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Yet, there are concerns about the ethics and justice of untrammeled investigations on a number of levels. On an organizational level, unconstrained investigations could interfere with, and damage, the organization's right to control the disclosure of their intellectual capital. On an individual level, those being investigated could easily have their legal privacy rights violated by forensics investigations. On a societal level, there might be a sense of injustice at the perceived inequality of current practice in this domain. This paper argues the need for a practical, ethically grounded approach to digital forensic investigations, one that acknowledges and respects the privacy rights of individuals and the intellectual capital disclosure rights of organizations, as well as acknowledging the needs of law enforcement. The paper derives a set of ethical guidelines, and then maps these onto a forensics investigation framework. The framework to expert review in two stages is subjected, refining the framework after each stage. The paper concludes by proposing the refined ethically grounded digital forensics investigation framework. The treatise is primarily UK based, but the concepts presented here have international relevance and applicability. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the lens of justice theory is used to explore the tension that exists between the needs of digital forensic investigations into cybercrimes on the one hand, and, on the other, individuals' rights to privacy and organizations' rights to control intellectual capital disclosure. Findings: The investigation revealed a potential inequality between the practices of digital forensics investigators and the rights of other stakeholders. That being so, the need for a more ethically informed approach to digital forensics investigations, as a remedy, is highlighted and a framework proposed to provide this. Research limitations/implications: The proposed ethically informed framework for guiding digital forensics investigations suggests a way of re-establishing the equality of the stakeholders in this arena, and ensuring that the potential for a sense of injustice is reduced. Originality/value: Justice theory is used to highlight the difficulties in squaring the circle between the rights and expectations of all stakeholders in the digital forensics arena. The outcome is the forensics investigation guideline, PRECEpt: Privacy-Respecting EthiCal framEwork, which provides the basis for a re-aligning of the balance between the requirements and expectations of digital forensic investigators on the one hand, and individual and organizational expectations and rights, on the other. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Ethics; Forensics investigation; Intellectual capital; Privacy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082201078

A comparative study was carried out considering countries for and against implementing a CBDC and their reasons, looking for common causes, differences, etc. The conclusion was that there are opposite tendencies between defenders and detractors of establishing a CBDC. However, today—and taking into account the positions of three large banking institutions (the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England) on establishing (at least in the short term) a CBDC)—it seems that large-scale implementation is still far off. On the contrary, the Chinese Central Bank and banking systems of other countries that have less weight in the world, such as Uruguay, Lithuania and the Bahamas, seem to go against the trend of rejection and are seriously considering its implementation. Although this matter has been dealt with in the theoretical field, more pilot tests such as the one carried out by Uruguay are necessary in order to understand specific effects on the economy, on one hand, and on acceptance of its use by the population, on the other. © 2020 by the authors.

There is a dearth of research on the mining of data of highway Freight Weight (FW), and this paper therefore aims to discover factors affecting road freight overloading based on highway FW data, with a view of developing strategies to mitigate such occurrences. A comprehensive sampling survey of road freight transportation was conducted in Anhui Province (China). Vehicle Characteristics (VC), Operation Mode (OM), and transportation information from a total of 3248 trucks were collected. In order to take advantage of the strengths associated with both statistical modelling techniques and non-parametric methods, a Classification And Regression Tree (CART) technique was integrated with Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) to reveal the factors affecting road freight overloading. The classification efficacy test shows that the BLR–CART method outperformed the BLR method in term of accuracy. It is also revealed that the factors affecting overloading of freight vehicles are the Type of Transportation (ToT), Rated Load (RL), OM, FW during the investigation period, interaction between RL and FW, and interaction among RL, FW, and Average Haul Distance (AHD). Road transport authorities should pay greater attention to these factors in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of overloading inspection. © 2020 The Author(s).

Such attacks may affect mission-critical applications that rely on sensor data for decision-making processes, hence, necessitates high assurance of trustworthy data. For the data trustworthiness, provenance is considered to be an effective mechanism that tracks both data acquisition and data transmission. However, provenance management for IoT networks is faced with several challenges such as low energy, bandwidth consumption, and efficient storage. In this paper, we propose a bi-fold Provenance-enabled Packed Path Tracing (PPPT) approach to identify packet drop (either maliciously or due to network disruptions) and detect faulty or misbehaving nodes in the Routing protocol for low-Power and Lossy networks (RPL). Firstly, ordered system-level provenance information encapsulates the data generating nodes and the forwarding nodes in the data packet. Secondly, to closely monitor the dropped packets, a node-level provenance in the form of the packet sequence number is enclosed as a routing entry in the routing table of each participating node. Lossless in nature, both approaches conserve provenance size satisfying processing and storage requirements of IoT devices. The experimental results show that the provenance size remains constant (i.e., 2 bytes) in the proposed scheme, irrespective of the number of hops or number of sent packets. Therefore, it does not affect factors such as memory usage (additional RAM and ROM usage: 504 and 3874 bytes respectively), energy consumption, and processing efficiency for provenance generation time in comparison to RPL-only approach. Furthermore, our proposed provenance-enabled RPL (PPPT) outperforms the RPL-only approach from the perspective of added security such as data trustworthiness and features such as identification of malicious nodes and other disruptions in the network. © 2020",6LoWPAN; Data trustworthiness; IoT; IPv6; LLN; Lossless provenance; RPL; Sensor networks,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081365999

Design/methodology/approach: The approach is tested using a guest satisfaction model encompassing nine dimensions. A large data set of 84 k online reviews and 31 features was collected from TripAdvisor. The review score granted was considered a proxy of guest satisfaction and was defined as the target feature to model. A sequence of data understanding and preparation tasks led to a tuned set of 60k reviews and 29 input features which were used for training the data mining model. Finally, the data-based sensitivity analysis was adopted to understand which dimensions most influence guest satisfaction. Findings: Previous user’s experience with the online platform, individual preferences, and hotel prestige were the most relevant dimensions concerning guests’ satisfaction. On the opposite, homogeneous characteristics among the Las Vegas hotels such as the hotel size were found of little relevance to satisfaction.

This results in a high price of delivered electricity which does not fairly differentiate between peak and non-peak users. Energy tariff is proven to be one of the best demand-side management (DSM) tools for shaping consumers’ behaviour. While electricity pricing models, such as inclining block and time-of-use tariffs, have received decent attention as successful mechanisms, there are little discussions about another efficient tariff known as a rollover network capacity charge. It is a penalty for the highest recorded power usage over the previous reading cycle (or year) which is introduced to commercial users in some jurisdictions. With recent price reduction in distributed generation and storage (DGS) systems, the interest has increased in devising policies for directing the household and commercial consumers’ behaviour towards using DGS systems in line with DSM objectives. In this paper, we have integrated the rollover network capacity charge into DGS systems investment analysis. The introduced optimisation formulation can consider capacity charge for both energy import and export. The results from a few case studies show the positive impact of capacity charge in directing the peak-consumers’ investment decisions towards DSM tools (e.g., energy storage) to curb their peak demands. This not only improves the resilience of the network but also promises as an effective mechanism in energy-justice nexus by avoiding the transfer of the associated costs of peak demand to all users. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Demand charge; demand-side management (DSM); distributed generation and storage (DGS); Energy equity; Energy-justice nexus; Rollover network capacity charge,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082604294

First, due to the variety of existing definitions, competing understandings, as well as the notion of positive presenteeism, it is important to reconsider the notion of presenteeism. Second, it is important to reflect on the measurement of the act of presenteeism and the productivity loss associated with that.

Nevertheless, it is very challenging to obtain high prediction accuracy with reasonable computational cost due to the complex spatial dependency on the traffic network and the time-varying traffic patterns. To address these issues, this paper develops a residual graph convolution long short-term memory (RGC-LSTM) model for spatial-temporal data forecasting considering the network topology. This model integrates a new graph convolution operator for spatial modelling on networks and a residual LSTM structure for temporal modelling considering multiple periodicities. The proposed model has few parameters, low computational complexity, and a fast convergence rate. The framework is evaluated on both the 10-min traffic speed data from Shanghai, China and the 5-min Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) traffic flow data.

The inherit constraints present in those networks, which result from the limitations of the edge devices in terms of power, computational capacity and storage, require an effective and efficient access control mechanism to be in place to provide suitable monitoring and control of actions and regulate the access over the resources. In this article, we present RESPOnSE, a framework for the specification and enforcement of security policies within such environments, where the computational burden is transferred to high-tier nodes, while low-tier nodes apply risk-aware policy enforcement. RESPOnSE builds on a combination of two widely used access control models, Attribute-Based Access Control and Role-Based Access Control, exploiting the benefits each one provides. Moreover, the proposed mechanism is founded on a compensatory multicriteria decision-making algorithm, based on the calculation of the Euclidean distance between the run-time values of the attributes present in the security policy and their ideal values, as those are specified within the established policy rules. © 2020 by the authors.

Accurate natural gas consumption forecasting allows policy makers to formulate natural gas supply planning and apply the right strategic policies in this direction. In order to develop a real accurate natural gas (NG) prediction model for Greece, we examine the application of neuro-fuzzy models, which have recently shown significant contribution in the energy domain. (2) Methods: The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a flexible and easy to use modeling method in the area of soft computing, integrating both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles. The present study aims to develop a proper ANFIS architecture for time series modeling and prediction of day-ahead natural gas demand. (3) Results: An efficient and fast ANFIS architecture is built based on neuro-fuzzy exploration performance for energy demand prediction using historical data of natural gas consumption, achieving a high prediction accuracy. The best performing ANFIS method is also compared with other well-known artificial neural networks (ANNs), soft computing methods such as fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and their hybrid combination architectures for natural gas prediction, reported in the literature, to further assess its prediction performance.

Our analysis consists of two stages: (i) measuring the efficiency scores of banks using the Semi-Oriented Radial Measure (SORM) DEA model, (ii) investigating the impact of alternative indicators of oil prices on the estimated efficiency scores after controlling for key bank-specific and country-specific variables. The analysis is based on an un-balanced panel data of banks operating in the Middle Eastern Oil-Exporting countries over the period of 2001-2011.

The right choice of a risk management model for a bank plays an important role in the sustainable development of competitiveness and the transformation of banking activities in the future. This work assesses bank risks and determines information risks in relation to the total capital of Santander Bank of Spain. The authors adapted an operational risk management (ORM) model to minimize the risks of the bank's digitalization and upcoming operational risks. The ratio of the total operational risk to the total bank's capital was 0.65%, which is below the permissible minimum value and is acceptable. Based on this indicator, diversification of business risks can be applied. As a result of the study, the total value of operational risks was calculated and the acceptability of this indicator to the capital of Santander Bank was assessed, which allowed the authors to assess whether the value was critical. In addition, it was also revealed that the main external risk of Santander Bank in 2018 was fraud in the use of online payments. The results might help to more effectively evaluate insurance payments for identified operational risks and effectively make decisions and optimize reporting documents of banks. © 2020 by the authors.",Cyberattacks; Digitalization; Diversification risk; Global banking ecosystem; Operational risk; Sustainable development; Sustainable financing,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086603053

However, from a thermodynamic point of view, the MFC process is still far from its potential maximum energy efficiency due to non-optimal execution of design variables. Therefore, the energy efficiency enhancement of the MFC process remains an ongoing issue. The design optimization after fixing the main configuration of the process is one of the most economic, but challenging exercises during the design stages. In this study, shuffled complex evolution (SCE) is studied to find the optimal design of the MFC process corresponding to minimal energy consumption in refrigeration cycles. The MFC process is simulated using Aspen Hysys® v10 and then coupled with the SCE approach, which is coded in MATLAB® 2019a. The refrigerant composition and operating pressures for each cycle of the MFC process were optimized considering the approach temperature inside the LNG heat exchanger as a constraint. The resulting optimal MFC process saved 19.76% overall compression power and reduced the exergy destruction up to 28.76%. The thermodynamic efficiency (figure of merit) of the SCE-optimized process was 25% higher than that of the published base case. Furthermore, the optimization results also imply that there is a trade-off between the thermodynamic performance improvement and the computational cost (no. of iterations). In conclusion, SCE exhibited potential to improve the performance of highly nonlinear and complex processes such as LNG processes. © 2020 by the authors.

The main factors that affect the forecasting accuracy are deterministic variables and weather variables such as types of days and temperature. Due to the tropical climate of Thailand, the marginal impact of weather variables on electricity demand is worth analyzing. Therefore, this paper primarily focuses on the impact of temperature and other deterministic variables on Thai electricity demand. Accuracy improvement is also considered during model design. Based on the characteristics of demand, the overall dataset is divided into four different subgroups and models are developed for each subgroup. The regression models are estimated using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) methods for uncorrelated errors, and General Least Square (GLS) methods for correlated errors, respectively. While Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network (FF-ANN) as a simple Deep Neural Network (DNN) is estimated to compare the accuracy with regression methods, several experiments conducted for determination of training length, selection of variables, and the number of neurons show some major findings. The first finding is that regression methods can have better forecasting accuracy than FF-ANN for Thailand's dataset. Unlike much existing literature, the temperature effect on Thai electricity demand is very interesting because of their linear relationship. The marginal impacts of temperature on electricity demand are also maximal at night hours. The maximum impact of temperature during night hours happens at 11 p.m., is 300 MW/°C, about 4% rise in demand while during day hours, the temperature impact is only 10 MW/°C to 200 MW/°C about 1.4% to 2.6% rise. © 2020 by the authors.

However, a middle-range (e.g., 5-20 days) forecasting is an extremely challenging task to get reliable forecasting results from a dynamical weather model. Nevertheless, it is challenging to develop and select an accurate time-series prediction model because it involves training various distinct models to find the best among them. In addition, selecting an optimum topology for the selected models is important too. The accurate forecasting of maximum temperature plays a vital role in human life as well as many sectors such as agriculture and industry. The increase in temperature will deteriorate the highland urban heat, especially in summer, and have a significant influence on people's health. We applied meta-learning principles to optimize the deep learning network structure for hyperparameter optimization. In particular, the genetic algorithm (GA) for meta-learning was used to select the optimum architecture for the network used. The dataset was used to train and test three different models, namely the artificial neural network (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Our results demonstrate that the hybrid model of an LSTM network and GA outperforms other models for the long lead time forecasting. Specifically, LSTM forecasts have superiority over RNN and ANN for 15-day-ahead in summer with the root mean square error (RMSE) value of 2.719 (°C). © 2020 by the authors.",Deep learning; Genetic algorithm; Meta-learning; Temperature forecasting; Time-series forecasting,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085649645

Successful intercity environmental cooperation relies on the clear identification and definition of the rights and obligations of each city. An Ecosystem services (ES) approach not only budgets the ES supply and demand of a city, but also defines the spatial relationships between Services Provisioning Areas (SPA) and Services Benefiting Areas (SBA). However, to date, quantitative studies integrating ES budgets and spatial relations have been scarce. This study integrates ecosystem services supply-demand budgeting with flow direction analysis to identify intercity environmental cooperation in the highly urbanized Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China for water-related ecosystem services (flood protection, erosion regulation and water purification). The results demonstrated that there were significant spatial mismatches in the supply and demand of three water-related ES among 16 core cities in the YRD region: five to six cities in the southern part of the region had significant service surpluses, while ten to 11 cities in the north-central part had significant service deficits. We then went on to offer definitions for Ecosystem Services Surplus City, Ecosystem Services Deficit City and Ecosystem Services Balance City, as well as Service Provisioning City, Service Benefiting City and Service Connecting City in which to categorize cities in the YRD Region. Furthermore, we identified two intercity cooperation types and two non-cooperation types. This framework can be used to promote ecological integration in highly urbanized regions to advance sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.",Ecosystem services; Spatial relationship; Supply and demand; Transboundary cooperation; Yangtze River Delta,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085610519

Whilst several advances have been made in health in recent years, the adoption of technology to combat social problems has lagged behind. In this paper, we explore Big Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to social systems; i.e., social computing, the concept of artificial intelligence as an enabler of novel social solutions. Through a critical analysis of the literature, we elaborate on the social and human interaction aspects of technology that must be in place to achieve such enabling and address the limitations of the current state of the art in this regard. We review cultural, political, and other societal impacts of social computing, impact on vulnerable groups, and ethically-aligned design of social computing systems. We show that this is not merely an engineering problem, but rather the intersection of engineering with health sciences, social sciences, psychology, policy, and law. We then illustrate the concept of ethically-designed social computing with a use case of our ongoing research, where social computing is used to support safety and security in home-sharing settings, in an attempt to simultaneously combat youth homelessness and address loneliness in seniors, identifying the risks and potential rewards of such a social computing application. © 2020 by the authors.",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Machine learning; Social computing; Social systems,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085552590

One of the most challenging and fundamental problems in object detection is locating a specific object from the multiple objects present in a scene. Earlier traditional detection methods were used for detecting the objects with the introduction of convolutional neural networks. From 2012 onward, deep learning-based techniques were used for feature extraction, and that led to remarkable breakthroughs in this area. This paper shows a detailed survey on recent advancements and achievements in object detection using various deep learning techniques. Several topics have been included, such as Viola-Jones (VJ), histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), one-shot and two-shot detectors, benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, speed-up techniques, and current state-of-art object detectors. Detailed discussions on some important applications in object detection areas, including pedestrian detection, crowd detection, and real-time object detection on Gpu-based embedded systems have been presented.

For this purpose, similar studies in the literature have been examined and nine different criteria have been determined for three dimensions affecting the use of coal energy. In order to determine the most important factors, an analysis is performed with IT2 fuzzy DANP method. The most important contribution of this study to the literature is that a proposal can be made for the use of coal energy by considering both positive and negative opinions related to this energy. On the other hand, IT2 fuzzy DANP method has been taken into consideration in this study for the first?time regarding coal energy and it is believed that methodological originality has been achieved. It is identified that social factors have the most importance in the use of coal energy. In this context, environmental pollution, health problems and demographic factors resulting from the use of coal energy should be taken into consideration in the use of this energy. Thus, problems arising from the use of coal energy far outweigh the economic benefits of using this energy. Therefore, factors that may prevent air pollution, such as carbon capture technology, should be considered in the use of coal energy. In addition, the use of high?quality coal will contribute to the reduction of the problems caused with this energy. In addition, investing in renewable energy sources that do not have negative impacts on the environment is also important for the sustainability of future energy policies. © 2020 by the authors.

People can be informed about their health and 24/7 monitoring can sometimes easily detect specific diseases, which are normally passed during routine ambulance operation. However, there is a problem with the reliability, quality, and quantity of the collected data. In normal life, there may be a loss of signal recording, abnormal growth of artifacts, etc. At this point, there is a need for multiple sensors capturing single variables in parallel by different sensing methods to complement these methods and diminish the level of artifacts.

However, the presence of severe metal artifacts in CBCT images hinders the accurate segmentation of each individual tooth. In this study, we propose a neural network for pixel-wise labeling to exploit an instance segmentation framework that is robust to metal artifacts. Our method comprises of three steps: 1) image cropping and realignment by pose regressions, 2) metal-robust individual tooth detection, and 3) segmentation. We first extract the alignment information of the patient by pose regression neural networks to attain a volume-of-interest (VOI) region and realign the input image, which reduces the inter-overlapping area between tooth bounding boxes. Then, individual tooth regions are localized within a VOI realigned image using a convolutional detector. We improved the accuracy of the detector by employing non-maximum suppression and multiclass classification metrics in the region proposal network. Finally, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform individual tooth segmentation by converting the pixel-wise labeling task to a distance regression task. Metal-intensive image augmentation is also employed for a robust segmentation of metal artifacts. The result shows that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially for teeth with metal artifacts. Our method demonstrated 5.68% and 30.30% better accuracy in the F1 score and aggregated Jaccard index, respectively, when compared to the best performing state-of-the-art algorithms. The major implication of the proposed method is two-fold: 1) an introduction of pose-aware VOI realignment followed by a robust tooth detection and 2) a metal-robust CNN framework for accurate tooth segmentation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cone beam computed tomography; Image segmentation; Pose regression neural network; Pose-aware tooth detection; Tooth instance segmentation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082699381

This research sets out to understand how information security culture is defined from an academic and industry perspective using a mixed-method approach. The definition, factors necessary to instil the ideal information security culture and the potential impact of the ideal information security culture were investigated from both perspectives. A survey approach was implemented to obtain the views from industry and 512 respondents from organisations, many of which operate at an international level, participated in the survey. The research presents a description of information security culture, integrating the existing literature and expanding on it with the views of industry, thereby giving clarity to the concept. The ideal information security culture was identified with the top traits relating to aspects such as an aware and knowledgeable workforce implementing conscientious, caring behaviour to comply with policies as guided by management. The factors that could positively influence an information security culture were identified, consolidated and expanded to five external factors and twenty internal factors. Organisations that have a strong information security culture were identified as achieving mutual trust and integrity through the protection of their information. The description of an information security culture can be used as a baseline to define and understand the concept, identify a single, comprehensive set of factors to be implemented, comprehend the traits of such a culture, as well as what an organisation can achieve by having a strong information security culture. The analysis showed that scientific interpretations of the definitions and factors of information security culture are much wider than their understanding of the industry. Both the results from the scoping review of papers and the feedback from the industry experts are synthesised visually to provide an organisational information security culture model (OISCM). The definition, factors, and model that influence the organisational culture of information security, have prognostic value for industry.

Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. © 2020",Agri-Food 4.0; Agriculture 4.0; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Blockchain; Internet of Things; Supply Chains,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079089114

It develops approaches based on modeling techniques, particularly on business process modeling, to ensure the quality and the global consistency of enterprise strategies and expectations. Nowadays, risk consideration in enterprise engineering is a growing concern since the business environment is becoming more and more competitive, complex, and unpredictable. To face this concern, a paradigm named risk-aware business process management (R-BPM) has recently emerged. It seeks to integrate the two traditionally isolated fields of risk management and business process management. Despite the significant benefits that can arise from the use of R-BPM, it suffers from a lack of solid scientific foundations and dedicated tooling. This present research work contributes to bridging that gap in a twofold way: (i) by establishing the BPRIM Business Process-Risk Integrated Method framework, and (ii) by designing a dedicated tool, named ADOBPRIM which supports the efficient application of the BPRIM framework. This paper first comprehensively presents the foundation of BPRIM which is based on three main components and, secondly, its dedicated tool ADOBPRIM which was designed using the ADOxx meta-modeling platform.

Actions should be taken for prevention and self-management. Analysis of warning factors is beneficial for patients, on which some previous studies focused. They generally used the professional medical test factors or complete factors to predict and prevent, but it was inconvenient and impractical for patients to self-manage. With this in mind, this study built a Bayesian network (BN) model, from the perspective of diabetic patients’ self-management and prevention, to predict six complications of T2DM using the selected warning factors which patients could have access from medical examination. Furthermore, the model was analyzed to explore the relationships between physiological variables and T2DM complications, as well as the complications themselves. The model aims to help patients with T2DM self-manage and prevent themselves from complications. Methods: The dataset was collected from a well-known data center called the National Health Clinical Center between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2009. After preprocess and impute the data, a BN model merging expert knowledge was built with Bootstrap and Tabu search algorithm. Markov Blanket (MB) was used to select the warning factors and predict T2DM complications. Moreover, a Bayesian network without prior information (BN-wopi) model learned using 10-fold cross-validation both in structure and in parameters was added to compare with other classifiers learned using 10-fold cross-validation fairly. The warning factors were selected according the structure learned in each fold and were used to predict. Finally, the performance of two BN models using warning features were compared with Naïve Bayes model, Random Forest model, and C5.0 Decision Tree model, which used all features to predict. Besides, the validation parameters of the proposed model were also compared with those in existing studies using some other variables in clinical data or biomedical data to predict T2DM complications. Results: Experimental results indicated that the BN models using warning factors performed statistically better than their counterparts using all other variables in predicting T2DM complications. In addition, the proposed BN model were effective and significant in predicting diabetic nephropathy (DN) (AUC: 0.831), diabetic foot (DF) (AUC: 0.905), diabetic macrovascular complications (DMV) (AUC: 0.753) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DK) (AUC: 0.877) with the selected warning factors compared with other experiments. Conclusions: The warning factors of DN, DF, DMV, and DK selected by MB in this research might be able to help predict certain T2DM complications effectively, and the proposed BN model might be used as a general tool for prevention, monitoring, and self-management. © 2020",Bayesian network; Prevention; Self-management; Type 2 diabetes mellitus complications; Warning factors,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077363413

In line with the micro-level component of the recently advanced “theory of network ecology”, results suggest that features of an individual's proximal environment can powerfully moderate the relative expression of network-formation mechanisms such that for some individuals, a dynamic may be expected to hold substantial sway over the process of choosing social contacts and, for others, no sway at all. © 2019 The Author",China; Ecology; Farming; Friendship; Network formation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076477555

This study partially plugs this knowledge gap and, by reviewing examples of existing applications of BCT in various economic sectors and across different consumption markets, evaluates its potential for future integration into hospitality operations management.

Yet the phenomenon has received only limited attention in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) literature. In response, we first conduct a broad systematic review of the literature to assess how China’s BRI is portrayed. Using this as a backdrop, we then distil the likely impact of the BRI on location decisions and supply chain flows. Finally, in a broader discussion of the SCM literature, we explore the implications of the BRI for future research in four key areas: supply chain configuration, supply chain resilience, sustainable SCM, and cross border SCM. While these areas are not new, the BRI presents a unique context that can be used to enhance theory and understanding in each area. The BRI reduces time distance independent of geographical distance by diverting supply chain flows from established routes to new routes via far less accessible regions. This introduces new risks and sustainability issues that call for multi-criteria decision support systems. Another important issue is the adoption and diffusion of the BRI since this will ultimately determine project success. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); global manufacturing; global supply chain; supply chain design; supply chain management,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064575273

In past few decades, the urban groundwater resources declined significantly due to over exploitation, urbanization, population growth and climate change. To understand the role of these variables on groundwater level fluctuation, we developed a machine learning based modelling approach considering singular spectrum analysis (SSA), mutual information theory (MI), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The developed approach was used to predict the groundwater levels in Bengaluru, a densely populated city with declining groundwater water resources. The input data which consist of groundwater levels, rainfall, temperature, NOI, SOI, NIÑO3 and monthly population growth rate were pre-processed using mutual information theory, genetic algorithm and lag analysis. Later, the optimized input sets were used in ANN and SVM to predict monthly groundwater level fluctuations. The results suggest that the machine learning based approach with data pre-processing predict groundwater levels accurately (R > 85%). It is also evident from the results that the pre-processing techniques enhance the prediction accuracy and results were improved for 66% of the monitored wells. Analysis of various input parameters suggest, inclusion of population growth rate is positively correlated with decrease in groundwater levels. The developed approach in this study for urban groundwater prediction can be useful particularly in cities where lack of pipeline/sewage/drainage lines leakage data hinders physical based modelling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial neural network; Genetic algorithm; Machine learning; Mutual information; Support vector machine; Urbanization,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076588138

Aiming at addressing the lateral control problem for an autonomous road sweeper, a heading-error-based first order linear active disturbance rejective controller (HFO-LADRC) is proposed in this paper. To eliminate the lateral error and the heading error at the same time, a new model, called the heading-error-based model, is proposed for lateral motion, and the Lyapunov function was employed to explore the convergence ability of the heading error and lateral error. Since the heading-error-based model is first order, the ADRC is designed as first order and linear, and each module of the HFO-LADRC has been devised in detail. To ensure solution accuracy, the fourth order Runge–Kutta method was adopted as the differential system solver, and a typical ring scenario and a double lane-changing scenario were designed referencing the standard. Considering the obvious influence, wheelbase uncertainty, steering ratio uncertainty and Gaussian white noise disturbance were taken into account for the tests. The results illustrate that, in the case of both wheelbase uncertainty and steer ratio uncertainty, the HFO-LADRC has strong robustness and stability compared with a typical pure pursuit controller and classical SO-LADRC. © 2020 by the authors.

The bottom-up approach is becoming increasingly popular because it can estimate ship fuel consumption by accounting for ship activity conditions, such as changes in voyage speed, time, and distance; however, its use is still limited when estimating ship fuel consumption. Ship-specific information, such as the daily fuel consumption rate for main and auxiliary engines for every vessel, is expensive to gather, and generally not collected from private shipping companies. To address this research gap, we develop simplified and composite ship fuel consumption models for ocean-going container ships by size using a regression model. To estimate the fuel consumption models for container ships, we rely on ship activity data, including average speed and sailing time, distance, and actual fuel consumption for main and auxiliary engines. This information is obtained from a major container shipping company in Korea. We estimate and validate the parameters associated with fuel consumption for five different container ship sizes, all of which are smaller than the Post-Panamax container ship (15,000 TEU and above). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Liner shipping; ocean-going container ships; regression model; ship fuel consumption model; Voyage-based approach,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074834746

In this study, BBNs were applied to elicit and discuss local stakeholders’ concerns in conflicts over water resource planning in two cases in southern Thailand. One concerned the construction of a dam proposed by a top-down project. The other concerned a bottom-up participatory process at the catchment scale to assess the need for water resources interventions and explore perceptions on alternative design options. In the top-down project, the responses of participants during the elaboration of the BBN showed that potentially affected stakeholders were particularly concerned about limited consultation and lack of shared benefits, which led them to oppose the dam project. In the bottom-up project, local stakeholders expected and agreed with the benefits of a dam, proposing to locate the dam upstream of community land. The BBN method did not facilitate dialogue in the top-down dam-building project because no alternative design options could be discussed and potentially affected stakeholders did not want to discuss compensation because of mistrust and differences in valuation of effects. In the bottom-up project, the BBN method did facilitate dialogue on alternative intervention options and their effects. The replicable BBN framework can support policy-makers to better understand water conflict situations in different stages of planning. Its application supports exploring a wider repertoire of options, enlarging the scope for more inclusive and sustainable solutions to water resource conflicts. © 2020, The Author(s).",Bayesian belief network; Conflicts; Policymakers; Stakeholder involvement; Water resources planning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088092791

Firstly, the water body information was extracted from ETM+ data and PALSAR data, and combined into a benchmark image. Next, several traditional image fusion methods were separately adopted to merge the ETM+453 image and the PALSAR HH image, and the water bodies extracted from the fused images were compared in details. The selected methods include principal component analysis (PCA), Brovey transform (BT), intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and high-pass filter (HPF). After that, a new image fusion method was designed based on optimal band combination (OBC), and the water bodies extracted by the method were compared with the benchmark image and those extracted by the traditional methods. The results show that the ALOS HH image alone achieved higher accuracy in water body extraction than the ETM+ image alone; the traditional image fusion methods, namely, PCA, BT, IHS, HPF and DWT, were more accurate than the ETM+ image alone in water body extraction, and less accurate than the ALOS HH image alone. The OBC-based image fusion method greatly outperformed all the traditional methods.

One of the applications is the logistics system, especially for the point to point delivery. The current parcel delivery system is delivered through the logistics hub despite latent economic disadvantages in terms of delivery time and delivery distance. The major disadvantage of current hub and spoke delivery system is that individual parcels must go to the logistics hub first even if the origin and destination are nearby or within a distance that can be delivered through the hub. These sorts of delivery are inefficient and increase total expense of delivery in terms of delivery time and delivery costs.

In addition, we addressed the difficulties with issues such as linking IoT device into IoT platforms and designing IoT device functionalities.

Our search ranged from the date of the first relevant article until the end of 2018. The results generated demonstrated the following: (a) Only single practices and methods have been studied to assess the impacts on single ecosystem services; (b) Soil quality and health are considered a key indicator of sustainable agriculture; (c) Although the assessed practices and methods were shown to improve the biodiversity of agrosystems, which makes them more resilient to extreme climate events, we are still far from developing interdisciplinary and multidimensional agriculture that integrates all management aspects and generates a full range of ecosystem services. In conclusion, this study addressed the following recommendations for the scientific community and policymakers to orient future research strategies and efforts: (a) The integration of all agrosystem services into sustainable management using an ecosystem-based approach on a life-cycle basis using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method; (b) Improving the scientific understanding of traditional knowledge to facilitate greater synergy and further integration; (c) The unification of assessment methods and indicators for the quantification of impacts; (d) The creation of a platform to share, monitor, screen, and approve assessments and evaluations of sustainable agriculture by region. © 2020 by the authors.",Agrosystems; Climate change; Resilience; Sustainable agriculture; Systematic review,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084610602

The analysis with Python technology, including optimized artificial intelligence technology, is designed on the basis of symmetry principles. Destination image perception as a branch of destination image research is of great significance to tourists' decision-making and destination image building. Ice-snow tourism is a hot topic nowadays, and research on perceptions of images of ice-snow tourism has become a focus. In this paper, python programming was used to crawl online travel journals and reviews about Jilin province's ice-snow tourism on the Internet to analyze the frequency of frequently used words, their classification, word cloud and co-occurrence network, and other aspects of image perception, and proceed to the emotional perception of and emotional attitude to the emotional images and an overall image analysis. The study found that: (1) Perceptions of images of ice-snow tourism can be divided into five categories: tourism attractions, tourism activities, tourism facilities, tourism features and the tourism service environment. The frequency of tourism attractions is the highest, followed by tourism facilities and the tourism service environment. ""Changbai Mountain"" and ""rime"" are the core words, that is, tourists are most impressed by the scenic spot and landscape of ""Changbai Mountain and rime."" (2) Positive emotional expressions accounted for 67.23% of perceptions of images of ice-snow tourism. Tourists gave a positive evaluation for Changbai Mountain, the snow landscape of Tianchi and skiing facilities. Meanwhile, passive emotional expressions accounted for 21.07% and tourists gave passive evaluations for travel, transportation, accommodation and catering. (3) Tourists spoke highly of overall images of ice-snow tourism in Jilin Province but few were willing to revisit. In the conclusion, strategies are put forward to improve image perceptions of ice-snow tourism and promote the sustainable development of ice and snow tourism. © 2020 by the author.",Artificial intelligence; Ice-snow tourism; Python; Sustainable development; Text mining,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084400045

The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model has been widely used for forecasting air temperature, but generally it has a systematic bias due to its coarse grid resolution and lack of parametrizations. This study used random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi-model ensemble (MME) to correct the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS; a local NWP model over Korea) model outputs of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures ((Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.)) in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 14 LDAPS model forecast data, the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of in-situ observations, and five auxiliary data were used as input variables. The results showed that the LDAPS model had an R2 of 0.69, a bias of ?0.85 °C and an RMSE of 2.08 °C for (Formula presented.) forecast, whereas the proposed models resulted in the improvement with R2 from 0.75 to 0.78, bias from ?0.16 to ?0.07 °C and RMSE from 1.55 to 1.66 °C by hindcast validation. For forecasting (Formula presented.), the LDAPS model had an R2 of 0.77, a bias of 0.51 °C and an RMSE of 1.43 °C by hindcast, while the bias correction models showed R2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.87, biases from ?0.03 to 0.03 °C, and RMSEs from 0.98 to 1.02 °C. The MME model had better generalization performance than the three single machine learning models by hindcast validation and leave-one-station-out cross-validation. ©2020.

Only 2.5% of all the water on Earth is freshwater and can be used to meet basic human needs such as a clean supply of water for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Water scarcity is the result of an imbalance between supply and demand. Efficient water resource management is definitely of interest to research and is a practical topic. At the same time, water-related disasters such as floods and droughts cause the loss of life and property. Disasters increase the difficulty of effective water resource management. An increase in climate extremes can also increase the risk of floods and droughts. This overview covers 150 peer-reviewed journal publications from the last twenty years focusing on risk-reduction strategies for floods and droughts. First, a definition and classification of flood and drought was introduced. Second, studies and techniques associated with risk reduction were grouped into three themes and discussed: prediction and warning; monitoring and impact assessment, response, and management. As a result, many studies were solely focused on, and achieve excellence in, their own themes. Special attention was needed to find in these studies what can convert the adverse impacts such as flood water to positive outcomes such as drought relief. Multidisciplinary cooperation is necessary to achieve sustainability and to adapt to climate change. Finally, advanced techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) were foreseen to have a tremendous impact on future disaster risk reduction. © 2020 by the authors.",Climate change; Disaster; Resilience; Sustainability; Water management,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083647649

Based on this premise, electricity generation and distribution firms such as Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) are faced with an urgent need to enhance availability and reliability through capacity expansion as well as the institutionalisation of cost-effective maintenance and asset management (MAM) principles. Some of the principles recommended here involve embedding customised overall health index (OHI) and total life cycle cost (LCC) estimation principles into engineering decisions that relate to asset renewal and/or replacement. While discussions about the fundamental theories and estimation approaches for OHI and LCC for power transformers (PTs) already exist in the current body of literature, however, they are mostly in a generic form which has somewhat limited proper implementation of these valuable principles in practice. This study is unique because it provides a very systematic framework towards achieving cost-effective MAM through a case study. Additionally, the proposed framework is all-encompassing, as it also assesses the impacts of human unreliability through the application or proven risk assessment techniques. The proposed framework commences with the evaluation of existing decision support system at PLN through a MAM audit, whereby the performance of the West Java arm of PLN with regards to critical MAM elements was examined. © 2020 by the authors.

They provide a conversational service to customers around-the-clock and make their daily life manageable. With this emerging trend, many well-known companies launched their own virtual assistants that manage the daily routine activities of customers. In the healthcare sector, virtual medical assistants also provide a list of relevant diseases linked to a specific symptom. Due to low accuracy and uncertainty, these generated recommendations are untrusted and may lead to hypochondriasis. In this study, we proposed a Medical Instructed Real-time Assistant (MIRA) that listens to the user's chief complaint and predicts a specific disease. Instead of informing about the medical condition, the user is referred to a nearby appropriate medical specialist. We designed an architecture for MIRA that considers the limitations of existing virtual medical assistants such as weak authentication, lack of understanding multiple intent statements about a specific medical condition, and uncertain diagnosis recommendations. To implement the designed architecture, we collected the chief complaints along with the dialogue corpora of real patients. Then, we manually validated these data under the supervision of medical specialists. We then used these data for natural language understanding, disease identification, and appropriate response generation. For the prototype version of MIRA, we considered the cases of glaucoma (eye disease) and diabetes (an autoimmune disease) only. The performance measure of MIRA was evaluated in terms of accuracy (89%), precision (90%), sensitivity (89.8%), specificity (94.9%), and F-measure (89.8%). The task completion was calculated using Cohen's Kappa (k = 0.848) that categorizes MIRA as 'Almost Perfect'. Furthermore, the voice-based authentication identifies the user effectively and prevent against masquerading attack. Simultaneously, the user experience shows relatively good results in all aspects based on the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) benchmark data. The experimental results show that MIRA efficiently predicts a disease based on chief complaints and supports the user in decision making. © 2020 by the authors.",Chief complaint; Disease diagnosis; Medical specialist; Primary healthcare; Spoken natural language; Virtual medical assistant,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083588541

The recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the deployment of billions of interconnected, smart and adaptive devices in critical infrastructures like health, transportation, environmental control, and home automation. Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated questions to the field of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which represents a trade-off between users' right to privacy and the success of the forensics investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security challenges. Furthermore, this work provides an overview of the past and current theoretical models in the digital forensics science. Special attention is paid to frameworks that aim to extract data in a privacy-preserving manner or secure the evidence integrity using decentralized blockchain-based solutions. In addition, the present paper addresses the ongoing Forensics-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm, as well as some promising cross-cutting data reduction and forensics intelligence techniques.

In social Internet of things, accuracy and reliability are standard features to discerning decisions. We assume that decision support systems based on social Internet of things could leverage research from recommender systems to achieve more stable performance. Therefore, we propose a trust-aware recommender systems suitable for social Internet of things. Trust-aware recommender systems adapt the concept of social networking service and utilize social interaction information. Trust information not only improves recommender systems from opinion spam problems but also more accurately predicts users’ preferences. We confirm that the performance of a recommender system becomes more improved when implicit trust is able to satisfy the properties of trust in the social Internet of things environment. The structure and amount of social link information are context-sensitive, so applying the concept of trust into social Internet of things environments requires a method to optimize implicit and explicit trust with minimal social link information. Our proposed method configures an asymmetric implicit trust network utilizing user–item rating matrix and transforms trust propagation metrics for a directional and weighted trust network.

Efficient management of these virtual resources is of great importance, as it has a direct impact on both the scalability and the operational costs of the cloud environment. Recently, containers are gaining popularity as virtualization technology, due to the minimal overhead compared to traditional virtual machines and the offered portability. Traditional resource management strategies however are typically designed for the allocation and migration of virtual machines, so the question arises how these strategies can be adapted for the management of a containerized cloud. Apart from this, the cloud is also no longer limited to the centrally hosted data center infrastructure. New deployment models have gained maturity, such as fog and mobile edge computing, bringing the cloud closer to the end user. These models could also benefit from container technology, as the newly introduced devices often have limited hardware resources. In this survey, we provide an overview of the current state of the art regarding resource management within the broad sense of cloud computing, complementary to existing surveys in literature. We investigate how research is adapting to the recent evolutions within the cloud, being the adoption of container technology and the introduction of the fog computing conceptual model. Furthermore, we identify several challenges and possible opportunities for future research. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cloud computing; Containers; Edge computing; Fog computing; Resource management; Survey; Virtual machines,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075375284

Learning from unplanned autonomous biological adaptation may be considered undesirable and incompatible with human endeavor. However, it is argued that there is no need for agency, and planned adaptation is not necessarily preferable over autonomous adaptation. What matters is the efficacy of adaptive mechanisms and their capacity to increase societal resilience to current and future impacts. In addition, there is great scope for industrial ecology (IE) to contribute approaches to climate change adaptation that generate system models and baseline data to inform decision making. The problem of “uncertainty” was chosen as an example of a challenge that is shared by biological systems, IE, and climate change adaptation to show how biological adaptation might contribute solutions. Finally, the Coastal Climate Adaptation Decision Support tool was used to demonstrate how IE and biological adaptation approaches may be mainstreamed in climate change adaptation planning and practice. In conclusion, there is close conceptual alignment between evolutionary biology and IE. The integration of biological adaptation thinking can enrich IE, add new perspectives to climate change adaptation science, and support IE's engagement with climate change adaptation. There should be no major obstacles regarding the collaboration of industrial ecologists with the climate change adaptation community, but mainstreaming of biological adaptation solutions depends greatly on successful knowledge transfer and the engagement of open-minded and informed adaptation stakeholders. © 2019 by Yale University",biological adaptation; biologically inspired design; climate change adaptation; evolution; industrial ecology,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068458528

This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data.

While much extant literature uses a deductive approach for identifying guest satisfaction dimensions, we apply an inductive approach by utilizing large unstructured text data of 104,161 online reviews of Korean accommodation customers to frame which topics of interest guests find important. Using latent Dirichlet allocation, a generative, Bayesian, hierarchical statistical model, we extract and validate topics of interest in the dataset. The results corroborate extant literature in that dimensions, such as location and service quality, are important. However, we extend existing dimensions of importance by more precisely distinguishing aspects of location and service quality. Furthermore, by comparing the characteristics of the accommodations in terms of metropolitan versus rural and the type of accommodation, we reveal differences in topics of importance between different characteristics of the accommodations. Specifically, we find a higher importance for points of competition and points of uniqueness among the accommodation characteristics. This has implications for how managers can improve customer satisfaction and how researchers can more precisely measure customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry. © 2020 by the authors.

The Validation of the approach was performed by comparing the flashing data of male fireflies, Sclerotia aquatilis that was obtained from the analysis of the behavioral video. The pulse duration, flash interval, and flash patterns of S. aquatilis were similar to a reference study. The accuracy ratio of the tracking algorithm for tracking multiple fireflies was 0.94.

In this study, the experimental results of 127 soil samples from national highway project Hai Phong-Thai Binh of Vietnam were used to generate datasets for training and validating models. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method was used to evaluate and compare performance of the proposed model with single RF model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) achieved a high accuracy performance (R = 0.89) in the prediction of shear strength of soil. Validation of the models also indicated that RF-PSO model (R = 0.89 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.453) is superior to the single RF model without optimization (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.48).

While the dataset provides a large amount of high-quality and multi-source driving information, people in academia are more interested in the underlying driving policy programmed in Waymo self-driving cars, which is inaccessible due to AV manufacturers' proprietary protection. Accordingly, academic researchers have to make various assumptions to implement AV components in their models or simulations, which may not represent the realistic interactions in real-world traffic. Thus, this paper introduces an approach to learn a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for imitating the behavior of Waymo's self-driving model.

Understanding the development of typhoon events will provide valuable knowledge for disaster prevention and mitigation. In the age of big data, the sharp contrast between the sudden increase of mass information and the lack of a knowledge appreciation mechanism appears. There is an urgent need to promote the transformation of information services to knowledge services in the field of hazard management. Knowledge representation, as a strategy for symbolizing and formalizing knowledge, affects knowledge acquisition, storage, management, and application, and is the basis and prerequisite for the implementation of knowledge services. Based on the evolution law of typhoon events and human cognitive habits, a formal knowledge representation method for typhoon events (TKRM) is proposed in this paper. First, by analyzing the evolution characteristics of typhoon events, the TKRM framework with three layers consisting of ""event-process-state"" was constructed, which was used to describe the knowledge composition and relationship of the different granularity of typhoon events. Second, the formal representation of the TKRM framework was formed by using a finite state machine (FSM) as a reference, taking time and location as the basic conditions, and extending the hierarchical and parallel representation mechanism. Finally, the rationality and practical value of the TKRM were verified using a case study. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to a series of reasons, including low signal-to-noise ratios, there are great challenges for efficient motor imagery classification. The recognition of left and right hand MI-EEG signals is vital for the application of BCI systems. Recently, the method of deep learning has been successfully applied in pattern recognition and other fields. However, there are few effective deep learning algorithms applied to BCI systems, particularly for MI based BCI. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that combines continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a simplified convolutional neural network (SCNN) to improve the recognition rate of MI-EEG signals. Using the CWT, the MI-EEG signals are mapped to time-frequency image signals. Then the image signals are input into the SCNN to extract the features and classify them. Tested by the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b, the experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the nine subjects is 83.2%, and the mean kappa value is 0.651, which is 11.9% higher than that of the champion in the BCI Competition IV. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed CWT-SCNN algorithm has a better classification performance and a shorter training time. Therefore, this algorithm could enhance the classification performance of MI based BCI and be applied in real-time BCI systems for use by disabled people. © 2020 by the authors.",continuous wavelet transform (CWT); electroencephalogram (EEG); motor imagery (MI); simplified convolutional neural network (SCNN),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082449749

The main threat to this species is human encroachment, led by entanglement in fishing gear. Information on this data-poor species’ ecology and habitat use is needed to effectively inform spatial management. Location: We investigated the habitat of a previously unstudied group of Irrawaddy dolphins in the eastern Gulf of Thailand, between the villages of Laem Klat and Khlong Yai, in Trat Province. This location is important as government groups plan to establish a marine protected area. Methods: We carried out boat-based visual line transect surveys with concurrent oceanographic measurements and used hurdle models to evaluate this species’ patterns of habitat use in this area. Results: Depth most strongly predicted dolphin presence, while temperature was a strong predictor of group size. The highest probability of dolphin presence occurred at around 10.0 m with an optimal depth range of 7.50 to 13.05 m. The greatest number of dolphins was predicted at 24.93°C with an optimal range between 24.93 and 25.31°C. Dolphins are most likely to occur in two primary locations, one large region in the center of the study area (11o54?18??N to 11o59?23??N) and a smaller region in the south (11o47?28??N to 11o49?59??N). Protections for this population will likely have the greatest chance of success in these two areas. Main Conclusions: The results of this work can inform management strategies within the immediate study area by highlighting areas of high habitat use that should be considered for marine spatial planning measures, such as the creation of marine protected areas.

Therefore, it is crucial to develop a PM10 forecasting model for early information and warning alerts to the responsible parties in order for them to mitigate and plan precautionary measures during such events. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and compare the best-fitted model for PM10 prediction from the first hour until the next three hours during transboundary haze events. The air pollution data acquired from the Malaysian Department of Environment spanned from the years 2005 until 2014 (excluding years 2007-2009), which included particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), wind speed (WS), ambient temperature (T), and relative humidity (RH) on an hourly basis. Three different stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models for predicting the PM10 concentration were then developed based on three different prediction hours, namely t+1, t+2, and t+3. The PM10, t+1 model was the best MLR model to predict PM10 during transboundary haze events compared to PM10,. t+2 and PM10, t+3 models, having the lowest percentage of total error (28%) and the highest accuracy of 46%. A better prediction and explanation of PM10 concentration will help the authorities in getting early information for preserving the air quality, especially during transboundary haze episodes. © 2020 by the authors.",Accuracy; Error; Malaysia; Multiple linear regression; Prediction; Transboundary haze,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082306221

Traditional precipitation prediction researches often established one or more probability models of historical data based on the statistical prediction methods and machine learning techniques. However, few studies have been attempted deep learning methods such as the state-of-the-art for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) networks in meteorological sequence time series predictions. We deployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network models for predicting the precipitation based on meteorological data from 2008 to 2018 in Jingdezhen City. After identifying the correlation between meteorological variables and the precipitation, nine significant input variables were selected to construct the LSTM model. Then, the selected meteorological variables were refined by the relative importance of input variables to reconstruct the LSTM model. Finally, the LSTM model with final selected input variables is used to predict the precipitation and the performance is compared with other classical statistical algorithms and the machine learning algorithms. The experimental results show that the LSTM is suitable for precipitation prediction. The RNN models, combined with meteorological variables, could predict the precipitation accurately in Jingdezhen City and provide sufficient time to prepare strategies against potential related disasters. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution. © 2020 by the authors.

However, now it is important to create very low energy information extraction or pattern recognition systems. In this paper, we present an approximate computing method to reduce the computation energy of a specific type of IoT system used for anomaly detection (e.g. in predictive maintenance, epileptic seizure detection, etc). Termed as Anomaly Detection Based Power Savings (ADEPOS), our proposed method uses low precision computing and low complexity neural networks at the beginning when it is easy to distinguish healthy data. However, on the detection of anomalies, the complexity of the network and computing precision are adaptively increased for accurate predictions. We show that ensemble approaches are well suited for adaptively changing network size. To validate our proposed scheme, a chip has been fabricated in UMC 65nm process that includes an MSP430 microprocessor along with an on-chip switching mode DC-DC converter for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Using NASA bearing dataset for machine health monitoring, we show that using ADEPOS we can achieve 8.95X saving of energy along the lifetime without losing any detection accuracy.

As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community.

These changes have spawned new challenges in the way with which the power grid should be managed. As a result, the development of new modelling approaches, as well as management techniques deemed “smart”, is called for to better monitor and control this increasingly complex system by taking into account the specificities of distributed generators (DGs) and their impact on the grid. This paper explores the evolution of power grids into “smart grids” in the light of the penetration of distributed generation and the features that ensue. Then, it gives an overview of notable works in the literature aimed at the modelling and control of power grids within this framework.

A key UN Target (6.5) for implementing sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 is to ‘implement integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels’. However, we argue that the current UN emphasis on measuring its implementation through institutional indicators limits our understanding of effectiveness, while ignoring links to other SDGs. While IWRM is often interpreted to mean the integration of water-related management components at the river basin scale, conceptualizations differ significantly. Specifying the critical normative principles of IWRM, therefore, becomes important for measuring its implementation. Drawing upon pre-existing conceptualizations, we consequently identify seven core principles or dimensions (integration; scale; institutions; participation; economic valuation; equity; and, environmental/ecological protection) to re-conceptualize IWRM after the adoption of agenda 2030. These dimensions, we argue, allow more objective measurement of IWRM implementation through the development of Target 6.5 sub-indicators. They also help shift IWRM beyond its current ‘water centric’ emphasis to enhance its contribution to achieving other SDGs such as those for ending poverty, providing clean and affordable energy, achieving gender equality, protecting terrestrial ecosystems, promoting sustainable cities, combatting hunger and climate change, and strengthening the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Goal 6; Indicators; Integrated water resources management; Sustainable development goals; Target 6.5,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073924908

Specifically, we vary levels of interaction fidelity to investigate how responsiveness and behavioural realism affect people’s experience of interacting with virtual humans. This is accomplished through the creation of Cinemacraft, a technology-mediated immersive platform for collaborative human–computer interaction. Cinemacraft leverages a voxel game engine similar to Minecraft to facilitate collaborative interaction in a virtual 3D world and incorporates sensory fusion to improve the fidelity of real-time collaboration. The primary hypothesis of the study is that embodied interactions result in a higher degree of presence, and that sensory fusion can improve the quality of presence and co-presence. We tested our hypothesis through a user-study of 24 participants. Based on suggestions from existing literature, we sidestep the uncanny valley effect through the use of low fidelity avatars (a la Minecraft) and identify cues that impact users ratings of presence, co-presence and successful collaboration.

Early outbreak detection and treatment application are inherent to effective pest management, allowing management decisions to be implemented before pests are well-established and crop losses accrue. Pest monitoring is time-consuming and may be hampered by lack of reliable or cost-effective sampling techniques. Thus, we argue that an important research challenge associated with enhanced sustainability of pest management in modern agriculture is developing and promoting improved crop monitoring procedures. Biotic stress, such as herbivory by arthropod pests, elicits physiological defense responses in plants, leading to changes in leaf reflectance. Advanced imaging technologies can detect such changes, and can, therefore, be used as noninvasive crop monitoring methods. Furthermore, novel methods of treatment precision application are required. Both sensing and actuation technologies can be mounted on equipment moving through fields (e.g., irrigation equipment), on (un)manned driving vehicles, and on small drones. In this review, we focus specifically on use of small unmanned aerial robots, or small drones, in agricultural systems. Acquired and processed canopy reflectance data obtained with sensing drones could potentially be transmitted as a digital map to guide a second type of drone, actuation drones, to deliver solutions to the identified pest hotspots, such as precision releases of natural enemies and/or precision-sprays of pesticides. We emphasize how sustainable pest management in 21st-century agriculture will depend heavily on novel technologies, and how this trend will lead to a growing need for multi-disciplinary research collaborations between agronomists, ecologists, software programmers, and engineers. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

This article seeks to document the impact of new technologies on international trade and to analyse the policy implications at the national and global level. A turning point is identified in the mid-1990s; up to 1995 there is no statistically significant relationship between internet usage and trade, but after 1997 the relationship is statistically significant. Use of the internet reduced trade costs, increased the size of trade flows and permitted greater fragmentation along global value chains. It also created opportunities for new international transactions, for example, based on ‘big data’.

Based on articles retrieved from the Web of Science database during the period 1992-2018, we found that the number of scientific publications, international collaborations, and allocated funds regarding depressive disorder among university students in China (97 articles, 43 international collaborations, and 52 funds provided, respectively) overwhelmingly surpassed the case of Korea (37 articles, 12 international collaborations, and 15 funds provided, respectively) and Japan (24 articles, 5 international collaborations, and 6 funds provided, respectively). The differences in collaboration patterns (p-value < 0.05) and the proportion of allocated funds (p-value < 0.05) among Korea, Japan, and China were also noted using Fisher's exact test. Based on the Poisson regression analysis, China's associations of scientific impact with international collaboration (? =-0.322, p-value < 0.01) and funding provision (? =-0.397, p-value < 0.01) are negative, while associations of the scientific impact and scientific quality with funding provision and international collaboration were statistically insignificant. These findings hint that Korea and Japan lacked scientific output, diversity in research targets, international collaboration, and funding provision, compared to China, but the quality of either China's internationally collaborated or funded articles was contentious. As a result, policymakers in Korea and Japan are suggested to raise the importance of mental health problems in their future policy planning and resource distribution. Moreover, it would be advisable to establish a rigorous system of evaluation for the quality of internationally collaborated and funded studies in order to increase scientific impact and maintain public trust, especially in China. © 2020 by the authors.",China; Depressive disorder; Funding; International collaboration; Japan; Korea; Scientific impact; Scientific output; Scientific quality; University student,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081201752

In comparisons with other Location Registration schemes, various studies on the Distance-Based Registration scheme and performance have been performed. However, a real network hierarchy has not been properly reflected in the performance evaluation of the Distance-Based Registration. To accurately evaluate the registration and paging costs of the Distance-Based Registration, a real network hierarchy should reflect that a mobile network is made up of many Visitor Location Register areas. Furthermore, we use an embedded Markov-Chain model in the Visitor Location Register hierarchy, which can reflect not only the Implicit Registration effect of the outgoing calls of user equipment but also cell staying time of the user equipment that may follow a general distribution. Without consideration of the Visitor Location Register, the paging cost decreases due to a small paging area, but the location registration cost rises because of frequent inter Visitor Location Register.

Two recent eruptions of Mount Agung on Bali Island, Indonesia, on November 21, 2017, and January 11, 2018, produced massive ash, steam, and gas emissions. Rainwater carried these pyroclastic materials in cold lahars to southwestern parts of the island. Because explosive eruptions of Mount Agung during 1963–1964 produced voluminous ashfall and catastrophic pyroclastic flows, the monitoring of this volcano has been considered essential. Land cover (LC) mapping is one method commonly used to monitor the spread of materials in volcanic areas due to the inaccessibility of field data during ongoing eruptions. We analyzed multispectral data using two different classifiers: an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM). Landsat imagery was used to generate a LC map with four feature classes: rock and sand, vegetation, cloud, and shadow. The ANN method was more accurate than the SVM method, with classification accuracies of 94.67% and 97% for the first and second Mount Agung eruptions, respectively. The SVM classifier was better than ANN at classifying images taken prior to eruption, with an overall accuracy of 91.60%. Thus, both classifiers accurately distinguished eruption products and environmental features, and are suitable for LC classification in volcanic regions. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Artificial neural network; Geographic information system; Landsat imagery; Mount Agung; Support vector machine; Volcanic eruption,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078751705

Due to the networking and computing capabilities of smartphones, these widespread personal devices have been proposed to deploy cost-effective wearable systems intended for automatic fall detection. In spite of the fact that smartphones are natively provided with inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes), the effectiveness of a smartphone-based FDS can be improved if it also exploits the measurements collected by small low-power wireless sensors, which can be firmly attached to the user’s body without causing discomfort. For these architectures with multiple sensing points, the smartphone transported by the user can act as the core of the FDS architecture by processing and analyzing the data measured by the external sensors and transmitting the corresponding alarm whenever a fall is detected. In this context, the wireless communications with the sensors and with the remote monitoring point may impact on the general performance of the smartphone and, in particular, on the battery lifetime. In contrast with most works in the literature (which disregard the real feasibility of implementing an FDS on a smartphone), this paper explores the actual potential of current commercial smartphones to put into operation an FDS that incorporates several external sensors. This study analyzes diverse operational aspects that may influence the consumption (as the use of a GPS sensor, the coexistence with other apps, the retransmission of the measurements to an external server, etc.) and identifies practical scenarios in which the deployment of a smartphone-based FDS is viable. © 2020 by the authors.

This move away from the dominant linear system where products are discarded at the end of product lifecycle is deemed necessary since it is the main cause of an accelerated resource consumption. Business models are considered as a key enabler for the shift from a linear to a CE. However, research on circular business models has mainly focused on circular approaches adopted by incumbent firms, while the contributions of newly established firms (the authors call these ’circular start-ups’) have been largely overlooked. This article scrutinises the business models of circular start-ups and how they may differ from those of incumbent firms embracing CE. For this, it analyses the circular business model strategies and innovations adopted by circular start-ups, relying on a novel data sample of 128 circular start-ups identified in three major CE ecosystems in Europe: the Randstad region in the Netherlands, Berlin and London. Based on this data, a novel typology of circular start-ups is proposed, distinguishing between five circular start-up archetypes: design-based, waste-based, platform-based, service-based and nature-based start-ups. The results also show that circular start-ups tend to embrace strategies corresponding to higher levels of circularity than those of incumbents.

They are valued in multiple ways for the services they provide to humans, including food production, recreation, water purification, navigation and amenity. Various groups of stakeholders all place different importance on these values, how their needs and practices interact, and what it means to effectively manage an estuary towards a range of desirable goals. This typically creates value conflicts over how estuaries should be managed. Navigating such conflicts requires governance arrangements and methods that allow multiple parties to find a common path forward. Using Evolutionary Governance Theory (EGT) and a hybrid analytic framework incorporating aspects of multi-level/multi-scalar governance, risk governance and territorial intelligence theory, this paper explores the (co-)evolution of governance processes by analysing lessons learnt from action in and observation of estuaries in Australia (Lower Hawkesbury), France (Thau) and New Caledonia (Thio). A multi-method research approach to data collection was used and comparative analysis across the three estuaries undertaken to understand the evolutions in each of their governance systems. From this analysis, several reflections and lessons for the governance of other land-sea systems emerge on: the importance of boundary organisations and boundary negotiations in re-defining integrated approaches to land-sea governance; how particular information systems or models, as well as discourses from other key actors shape co-evolutions of estuarine governance; and that risks or shocks still appear to be the catalysers of new forms of collective action and major reconfigurations and evolutions of estuarine governance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Boundary; Discourses; Estuary management; Evolutionary governance; Information systems; Risk perceptions,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074395938

Innovation in sustainable tourism studies is required to meet a number of challenges including socio-ecological impacts; the critical turn in tourism research; and the growth of ICTs, mobile technologies and big data analytics. These shifts in particular are transforming the field and creating new research opportunities. This article seeks to identify potentially new methodological areas of application to sustainable tourism studies for both quantitative and qualitative methods. A range of methods are reviewed, focusing on big data (e.g. mobile device signaling, GPS, social media and search engine data) that elucidates wider patterns of tourist movement, as applied to forecasting travel demands and sustainable management of a destination. Three novel “small data” methods are also discussed, comprising visual methods, autoethnography and qualitative GIS, that provide deeper, contextual insights into the drivers, dynamics and impacts of sustainable tourism. We consider how expansive qualitative methodologies might yield potentially important insights concealed by existing methodologies. Furthermore, we argue that combined big data and small data approaches can address methodological imbalance and generate mutually reinforcing insights at a number of levels. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big data; mobility; research methods; small data; sustainable tourism,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069002744

Predicting wind turbine capacity is becoming increasingly crucial for cleaner production. For this purpose, a new information priority accumulated grey model with time power is proposed to predict short-term wind turbine capacity. Firstly, the computational formulas for the time response sequence and the prediction values are deduced by grey modeling technique and the definite integral trapezoidal approximation formula. Secondly, an intelligent algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is applied to determine the optimal nonlinear parameters of the novel model. Thirdly, three real numerical examples are given to examine the accuracy of the new model by comparing with six existing prediction models. Finally, based on the wind turbine capacity from 2007 to 2017, the proposed model is established to predict the total wind turbine capacity in Europe, North America, Asia, and the world. The numerical results reveal that the novel model is superior to other forecasting models. It has a great advantage for small samples with new characteristic behaviors. Besides, reasonable suggestions are put forward from the standpoint of the practitioners and governments, which has high potential to advance the sustainable improvement of clean energy production in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Energy economics; Grey system model; Particle swarm optimization; Wind turbine capacity,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072977046

DFS allow unbanked people to obtain access to financial services through digital technologies. However, DFS face tough challenges of adoption. Realising this, the purpose of this paper is to identify such challenges and develop a framework. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a framework of challenges by utilising interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and fuzzy MICMAC approach. The authors explored 18 such unique set of challenges culled from the literature and further gathered data from two sets of expert professionals. In the first phase, the authors gathered data from 29 professionals followed by 18 professionals in the second phase. All were pursuing Executive MBA programme from a metropolitan city in South India. The implementation of ISM and fuzzy MICMAC provided a precise set of driving, linkage and dependent variables that were used to derive a framework. Findings: ISM model is split in eight different levels. The bottom level consists of a key driving challenge V11 (i.e. high cost and low return related problem), whereas the topmost level consists of two highly dependent challenges namely V1 (i.e. risk of using digital services) and V14 (i.e. lack of trust). The prescribed ISM model shows the involvement of “high cost and low return related problem (V11)”, which triggers further challenges of DFS. Originality/value: None of the existing research has explored key challenges to DFS in detail nor formulated a framework for such challenges. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper on DFS that attempts to collate its challenges and incorporate them in a hierarchical model using ISM and further divide them into four categories of factors using fuzzy MICMAC analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital divide; Digital intervention; E-commerce; E-inclusion/exclusion; E-marketing; Electronic mediated environment; Information society; IS professionals; Mobile system; Wireless technology,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065906363

It creatively integrates and employ innovative technologies such as the Internet of Health Things (IoHT), medical Cyber-Physical Systems (medical CPS), health cloud, health fog, big data analytics, machine learning, blockchain, and smart algorithms. The goal is to deliver improved, value-added and cost-effective healthcare services to patients and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency or the healthcare industry. Health 4.0 (adapted from the Industry 4.0 principles) changes the healthcare business model to enhance the interactions across the healthcare clients (the patients), stakeholders, infrastructure, and value chain. This effectively will improve the quality, flexibility, productivity, cost-effectiveness, and reliability of healthcare services in addition to increasing patients' satisfaction. However, building and utilizing healthcare applications that follow the Health 4.0 concept is a non-trivial and complex endeavor. In addition, advanced potential applications based on Health 4.0 capabilities are not yet being investigated. In this paper we define the main objectives of Health 4.0 and discuss advanced potential Health 4.0 applications. To have a clear understanding of these applications, we categorize them in 4 groups based on the primary beneficiary of these applications. Thus we have patient targeted applications, applications supporting healthcare professionals, resource management applications and high-level healthcare systems management applications. In addition, as we studied the different applications, we realized that these is a certain collection of services that these most of them need regardless of their goals or business context. Services supporting data collection and transfer, security and privacy, reliable operations are some examples. As a result we propose creating a service-oriented middleware framework to offers the common services to the applications developers and facilitate the integration of different services to build applications under the Health 4.0 umbrella. © 2013 IEEE.",COVID-19; Health 40; health cloud; health fog; healthcare systems; Industry 40; Internet of Health Things; medical cyber-physical systems; service integration; service-oriented middleware,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117785247

Existing research on human-mobile interaction and end-user mobile management only highlights the positive fronts of repetitive exposures to mobile ads, ignoring the negative. The present study examines the effects of Mobile Ad Wearout on irritation, intrusiveness, engagement, and loyalty via social media outlets. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were solicited from consumers in Jordan and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied on data (n = 388).

Our approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean temperature 18 °C–19 °C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of 24 °C– 25 °C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a temperature increase of 2 °C, relative to 1981–2014, results in the mean yield decreasing by 8%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that will ensure food security under a changing climate. © 2020 The Author(s).

Background AI based teaching and learning solutions are amongst the most important educational innovations. The intervention of AI in instructional methods can result in personalized teaching and learning experiences. AI enabled teaching and learning systems can give teachers a better understanding regarding their students’ learning abilities, learning styles and progress. Methodology The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to find the relative importance of inhibiting and motivating factors. The primary data for making the pair-wise comparisons between the factors were obtained from a convenient sample of 32 teachers, teaching in various higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi, India. Contribution Though, the acceptance of AI based solutions has been studied in other con-texts such as retail, banking, ecommerce, and so on; nonetheless, the acceptance of AI in the education sector has not grabbed much attention of researchers. Hence the study has made worthwhile contributions to the literature as it has specifically focused on the adoption of AI based teaching methods by teachers in higher education Findings The findings suggest that institutional barriers are the major inhibitors and recognition is the main motivator that affect teachers’ behaviour towards adopting AI based teaching solutions. Overall, the findings of the study highlight the importance of institutional support in terms of resources, time, and recognition that may be provided to the teachers so that they can willingly integrate AI based methodologies into their teaching. Recommendations for Practitioners The study provides several implications for HEIs and developers of AI based educational solutions. The HEIs should provide adequate support to their teachers in terms of financial support, infrastructure and technical support. The developers should focus on developing such solutions that are compatible with the teachers’ existing work style. Recommendations for Researchers Future studies can employ statistical techniques such as multiple regression analysis or structural equation modelling to examine the impact of these factors on the actual use behaviour of teachers regarding AI based teaching methods. More diversified samples that are statistically significant in size, can be considered to examine the teachers’ behaviour regarding AI based instructional methods. Impact on Society AI technology can play a pivotal role in reshaping and remodeling higher education. AI is the technology of todays’ times that has the capability of transforming the instructional methods. The educators need to understand that nowadays, teaching and learning are heading towards creative styles that embrace the use of innovative technologies such as AI. Future Research The adoption of AI in the field of education is at a very nascent stage in India, constant changes are likely to happen in the factors influencing the adoption of AI enabled teaching solutions. Future studies may come up with a more holistic model of factors to address this research problem. © 2020 (CC BY-NC 4.0) This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

In this study, hardware-oriented algorithms and a differential multiply-accumulation operation are proposed to overcome the difficulties of implementing CBMs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). A hardware-oriented algorithm for CBMs, which includes fixed-point operations and shift operations, is proposed to reduce hardware resource utilization in the implemented circuits. In particular, the differential multiply-accumulate operation allows us to implement the multiply-accumulate operation with block random access memory and digital signal processors to reduce the consumption of lookup tables and flip-flops in FPGAs without losing the calculation speed. Our proposed approach was evaluated in numerical simulations, logical synthesis, and FPGA implementation. The calculation speed of FPGA-implemented CBMs was compared with software-implemented CBMs, which resulted in 1 / 6,500 of calculation time reduction in a 300-neuron CBM. Moreover, 2,048 neurons of CBM were realized by the logical synthesis. Therefore, the proposed hardware implementation of CBMs was shown to be feasible. The proposed CBMs can solve combinatorial optimization problems at a larger scale with fewer resources. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Since such voice data contain personal information that can endanger the privacy of users, the issue of privacy protection in the speech data has garnered increasing attention after the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, which implies that restrictions and safety measures for the use of speech data become essential. This study aims to filter the speaker-related voice biometrics present in speech data such as voicefingerprint without altering the linguistic content to preserve the usefulness of the data while protecting the privacy of users. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm that produces anonymized speeches by adopting many-to-many voice conversion techniques based on variational autoencoders (VAEs) and modifying the speaker identity vectors of the VAE input to anonymize the speech data. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by measuring the speaker-related information and the original linguistic information retained in the resultant speech, using an open source speaker recognizer and a deep neural network-based automatic speech recognizer, respectively. Using the proposed method, the speaker identification accuracy of the speech data was reduced to 0.1 9.2%, indicating successful anonymization, while the speech recognition accuracy was maintained as 78.2 81.3%. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Moreover, with the popularity of the IoT in the context of edge computing, cloud-native applications that utilize geographically-distributed multiple resources are emerging. In line with this trend, there is an increasing demand for microservices placement that selectively use optimal resources. However, optimal microservices placement is a significant challenge because microservices are dynamic and complex, depending on diversi fied workloads. Besides, generalizing workloads' characteristics consisting of complex microservices is realistically challenging. Thus, microservices deployment with mathematically structured algorithms based on simulation is less practical. As an alternative, a microservices placement framework is required that can refiect the characteristics of workloads derived from empirical profiling. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a refinement framework for profiling-based microservices placement to identify and respond to workload characteristics in a practical way. To achieve this goal, we perform profiling experiments with selectedworkloads to derive delicate resource requirements. Then, we perform microservices placement with a greedy-based heuristic algorithm that considers application performance by using resource requirements derived from the profiled results. Finally, we verify the proposed concept by comparing the experimental results that use our work and those that don't. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Moreover, it is necessary to provide appropriate traffic information considering user locations and routes and design an analysis method accordingly. This paper proposes a word-embedding-based traffic document classification model for detecting emerging risks using a quantity termed sentiment similarity weight (SSW). The proposed method detects emerging risks by considering and classifying the importance and polarity of keywords in traffic document. Conventional sentiment analysis methods fail to utilize semantically significant keywords unless they are included in a sentiment dictionary. In this study, through word imputation using an established similarity dictionary and by widening the limited utilization range, the proposed method overcomes the disadvantage of sentiment dictionaries. The proposed method is evaluated through three tests. In the first, the similarity between keywords is measured, and thus model accuracy is evaluated. In the second test, three classifiers for emerging risk classification are compared. In the last test, emerging risk detection is assessed according to whether the proposed SSW is applied, and its effectiveness is therefore verified. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed traffic-related document classification model using the SSW has an f-measure of 0.907, indicating satisfactory performance. Therefore, the proposed SSW can be effectively used as a parameter in traffic-related document classification and enables the detection of emerging risks. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Today it is used for a multitude of data intensive projects in various domains and also serves as the technical foundation for other recent trends in the computer science domain. However, the complexity of its implementation and utilization renders its adoption a sophisticated endeavor. For this reason, it is not surprising that potential users are often overwhelmed and tend to rely on existing guidelines and best practices to successfully realize and monitor their projects. A valuable source of knowledge are use case descriptions, of which a multitude exists, each of them with a varying information density. In this design science research endeavor, 43 use cases are identified by conducting a thorough literature review in combination with the application and adaption of a corresponding template for big data projects. By a subsequent categorization, which is performed by identifying and employing a hierarchical clustering algorithm, nine different standard use cases emerge, as the contribution's artifact.

HHO demonstrated promising results compared to other optimization methods. However, HHO suffers from local optima and population diversity drawbacks. To overcome these limitations and adapt it to solve feature selection problems, a novel metaheuristic optimizer, namely Chaotic Harris Hawks Optimization (CHHO), is proposed. Two main improvements are suggested to the standard HHO algorithm. The first improvement is to apply the chaotic maps at the initialization phase of HHO to enhance the population diversity in the search space. The second improvement is to use the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to the current best solution to improve HHO exploitation. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, CHHO was applied on 14 medical benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The proposed CHHO was compared with the original HHO and some famous and recent metaheuristics algorithms, containing Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA), and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO). The used evaluation metrics include the number of selected features, classification accuracy, fitness values, Wilcoxon's statistical test (P-value), and convergence curve.

For this purpose, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy (IVIHF) sets is proposed. Firstly, a large literature review is carried out and 10 different factors that can affect electricity prices are determined. After that, IVIHF decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology is considered to find which factors are more significant in electricity prices. The finding shows that infiation rate and technological improvement are the most important criteria that affect electricity prices. Thus, the countries should consider expected future infiation rates to take necessary precautions to minimize volatility in electricity prices. Moreover, countries should follow current technologies regularly and make effective research and development to provide electricity with lower prices. In the second stage of the analysis, emerging 7 (E7) economies are ranked with respect to the performance related to the management of electricity price volatility. In this context, IVIHF VIeKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) approach is considered. It is concluded that Russia and China are the most successful countries in keeping electricity prices away from volatility whereas India and Turkey get the latest order. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation is also implemented by considering IVIHF technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodology to check the consistency of the analysis results. The results of both approaches are quite similar which gives information about the consistency of the ranking results. On the other hand, a sensitivity analysis is performed to ten different cases consecutively.

It is a challenge to realize efficient job scheduling and resource allocation of multiple users and data centers. However, the traditional scheduling model based on heuristic algorithm has some limitations in the complex and changeable cloud environment. In addition, many existing single-agent models rarely consider the multi-objective global optimization of the system. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage job scheduling and resource allocation framework that adopts multiple intelligent schedulers to solve the cooperative scheduling problem between job scheduling and resource allocation. A heterogeneous distributed deep learning (HDDL) model is used in the job scheduling stage to schedule multiple jobs to multiple cloud data centers. The deep Q-network (DQN) model is a resource scheduler to deploy virtual machine to physical servers for execution. Extensive numerical results show that both HDDL-baesd job scheduler and DQN-based resource allocator outperform the benchmark algorithm in terms of optimizing energy consumption and job delay. Furthermore, the proposed framework not only can achieve a global near-optimum by achieving local optimization at each stage but also has good scalability and low computation delay. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Machine Learning as a Service, (MLaaS) which leverages deep learning techniques for predictive analytics to enhance decision-making, has become a hot commodity. However, the adoption of MLaaS introduces data privacy challenges for data owners and security challenges for deep learning model owners. Data owners are concerned about the safety and privacy of their data on MLaaS platforms, while MLaaS platform owners worry that their models could be stolen by adversaries who pose as clients. Consequently, Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) arises as a possible solution to this problem. Recently, several papers about PPDL for MLaaS have been published. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has summarized the existing literature on PPDL and its specific applicability to the MLaaS environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of privacy-preserving techniques, starting from classical privacy-preserving techniques to well-known deep learning techniques. Additionally, we present a detailed description of PPDL and address the issue of using PPDL for MLaaS. Furthermore, we undertake detailed comparisons between state-of-the-art PPDL methods. Subsequently, we classify an adversarial model on PPDL by highlighting possible PPDL attacks and their potential solutions. Ultimately, our paper serves as a single point of reference for detailed knowledge on PPDL and its applicability to MLaaS environments for both new and experienced researchers.

In this study, three machine learning algorithms were used to predict variations in DOC concentrations in an Australian drinking water catchment as a function of climate, catchment and physical water quality data. Four independent variables including precipitation, temperature, leaf area index and turbidity (n ¼ 5,540) were selected from a large dataset to develop and train each machine learning model. The accuracy of the multivariable linear regression, support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process regression algorithms with different kernel functions was determined using adjusted R-squared (adj. R2), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Model accuracy was very sensitive to the time interval used to average climate observations prior to pairing with DOC observations. The SVR model with a quadratic kernel function and a 12-day time interval between climate and water quality observations outperformed the other machine learning algorithms (adj. R2 ¼ 0.71, RMSE ¼ 1.9, MAE ¼ 1.35). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve method (AUC) confirmed that the SVR model could predict 92% of the elevated DOC observations; however, it was not possible to estimate DOC values at specific sampling sites in the catchment, probably due to the complex local geological and hydrological changes in the sites that directly surround and feed each sampling point. Further research is required to establish potential relationships between climatological data and NOM concentration in other water catchments – especially in the face of a changing climate. © 2021 The Authors.",Climate; Machine learning; Natural organic matter; Water quality,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102295979

The present study aimed at identifying industry 4.0 neologisms, understanding the industry 4.0 disruption and illustrating the disruptive technology convergence in the major industrial sectors. A total of 99 neologisms of industry 4.0 were identified. Industry 4.0 disruption in the education industry (education 4.0), energy industry (energy 4.0), agriculture industry (agriculture 4.0), healthcare industry (healthcare 4.0), and logistics industry (logistics 4.0) was described. The convergence of 12 disruptive technologies including 3D printing, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, big data, blockchain, cloud computing, drones, Internet of Things, nanotechnology, robotics, simulation, and synthetic biology in agriculture, healthcare, and logistics industries was illustrated. The study divulged the need for extensive research to expand the application areas of the disruptive technologies in the industrial sectors. © 2020 Ocident Bongomin et al.",,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102092342

The study further investigates its effectiveness in enhancing the design communication and coordination between the stakeholder. Design/methodology/approach: Quasi-experimental research was adopted involving 12 FFE professionals, designers and end-users in single-group pre-test-post-test design. The tests were performed primarily to ascertain the impact of the application of interactive virtual reality on delivering furniture design selection and coordination tasks. Further interviews were used to elicit participants' views on the functionality and usefulness of the proposed approach. Findings: The findings indicate that an interactive immersive virtual FFE environment: enhances the productivity of the design team through a collaborative virtual workspace offering a synchronised networked design testing and review platform; reduces the time required for the stakeholders to comprehend the design options and test those; enhances the design communication and quality of the design and encourages the collaborative culture in the industry; improves the design satisfaction of the stakeholders; and finally, requires significantly less time for design decision-making when compared to traditional methods. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should incorporate space planning concepts and explore non-experimental methodologies in a real-life FFE project setup. Practical implications: The proposed approach provides opportunities for enhanced interpretation of design intent in FFE as well as efficiency in design selection and coordination tasks when compared with conventional two-dimensional methods of communication. Originality/value: This study proposes a step change in the way furniture design is communicated and coordinated through an immersive virtual experience. Previous studies have not addressed the issue of impact on design coordination instead focussed on marketing and sales. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",BIM; Design communication; Fixture and equipment; Furniture; Virtual reality; Visualisation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101438297

In recent years, the discussion in the reform literature has attracted significant attention from public administration scholars. It includes various methods and discusses a series of experiences of the reform movement around the world within multiple political landscapes, economic settings, and international turbulences. This paper presents the experience of administrative reform in Indonesia as one of the developing countries in Southeast Asia with a complex history of a colonial legacy. This study analyzes the prominent works of literature discussing the reform experience in Indonesia combined with theoretical perspectives of administrative reform. It highlights three major findings; first, the phenomenon of administrative reform in Indonesia was moving against the reform trend of most other developing countries; second, institutional arrangements play a critical role in repairing the reform trajectory; and third, the current progress of administrative reform in Indonesia still indicates the minimum achievement in some institutions. The discussion of this study, bordered by the settled time frame of reform implementation in Indonesia, is comprised of past and current experiences as well as the future projection of Indonesia administrative reform. © 2020 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

An efficient algorithm for solving MMOPs should balance the diversity and convergence of the population, so that the global optimal solutions can be located as many as possible. However, most of existing algorithms are easy to be trapped into local peaks and cannot provide high-quality solutions. To better deal with MMOPs, considerations on the solution quality angle and the evolution stage angle are both taken into account in this paper and a multi-angle hierarchical differential evolution (MaHDE) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, a fitness hierarchical mutation (FHM) strategy is designed to balance the exploration and exploitation ability of different individuals. In the FHM strategy, the individuals are divided into two levels (i.e., low/high-level) according to their solution quality in the current niche. Then, the low/high-level individuals are applied to different guiding strategies. Secondly, a directed global search (DGS) strategy is introduced for the low-level individuals in the late evolution stage, which can improve the population diversity and provide these low-level individuals with the opportunity to re-search the global peaks. Thirdly, an elite local search (ELS) strategy is designed for the high-level individuals in the late evolution stage to refine their solution accuracy. Extensive experiments are developed to verify the performance of MaHDE on the widely used MMOPs test functions i.e., CEC’2013. Experimental results show that MaHDE generally outperforms the compared state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The purpose of this paper is to examine the connection between the education for journalists as a scholarly and academic discipline (as well as a teaching practice) and the issues caused by fake news in the digital age of mass media. Based on a comprehensive critical conceptual analysis of the body of knowledge available on the subject, it was determined that there is a diverse discussion about the status of journalism education regarding fake news. In that context, fake news has so far been internationally researched from several angles – curriculum content, journalism students, journalism and media studies, journalism practice, media audience, etc. When addressing the issue of education of journalists and fake news, three streams can be singled out. The first and most voluminous one refers to the systematic formal or additional education regarding media and information literacy. The next one refers to various changes related to the higher education system for the education of journalists, but without any concrete propositions for system reconstruction or upgrading. The last one advocates providing additional professional education to employed journalists. From the local perspective, even though only two articles suggest journalism education as a solution for the problems caused by fake news, based on thorough research it can be concluded that fake news and journalism education are not yet topics of interest among communication scholars in Croatia. © 2020 Doron Fakultet Politickih Znanosti.

Current approaches to framing fall into two primary categories. On one hand, models grounded in reductionist perspectives tend to oversimplify the problems and thus fall short of capturing the true complexity that must be understood to make tangible progress. On the other, notable attempts to achieve holism are more effective at incorporating contextual nuance, but still lack systematicity to identify and drive effective inclusion of critical issues, and also tend to suffer from the inherent bias of select expert input. In this article, we report on an extension of holistic problem framing techniques called comprehensive success factor analysis (CSFA) that makes-sense of web-mined information reflective of both expert and general population perspectives as well as pattern-informed ontological knowledge organization structure, to yield ‘richer pictures’ of grand challenges. This method has been developed and refined over a seven-year period by application to a variety of distinct socio-technical challenges, and emphasizes that framing complex problems requires one to embrace multiple levels of abstraction, a plurality of perspectives, careful contextualization, and an overarching system view. The CSFA method results in ‘success factor trees’ that are more comprehensive than seen otherwise and present a holistic view of the essential factors that need to be considered when engaging in large scale socio-technical problems. The success factor trees provide common grounds for meaningful collaboration and discourse on grand challenges, facilitate more informed resource allocation decisions, and provide guidance for designing solutions through careful consideration of system factors that are not always apparent. The paper illustrates CSFA applied to the challenge of ‘food security for a nation in a low- to middle-income country context’ to ascertain the value of the approach and finds that it results in a robust view of the challenge that greatly exceeds perspectives arrived at in the literature using current framing methods, on dimensions of scope, levels of abstraction, plurality, and context detail. © 2020",Complex problem framing; Complex problem structuring; Comprehensive success factor analysis (CSFA); Grand challenges; International development; Knowledge representation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100199611

These wearables are small IoT devices capable of sensing, storing, processing, and exchanging data to assist users by improving their everyday life tasks through various applications. However, the IoWT has also brought new challenges for the research community to address such as increasing demand for enhanced computational power, better communication capabilities, improved security and privacy features, reduced form factor, minimal weight, and better comfort. Most wearables are battery-powered devices that need to be recharged - therefore, the limited battery life remains the bottleneck leading to the need to enhance the energy efficiency of wearables, thus, becoming an active research area. This paper presents a survey of energy-efficient solutions proposed for diverse IoWT applications by following the systematic literature review method. The available techniques published from 2010 to 2020 are scrutinized, and the taxonomy of the available solutions is presented based on the targeted application area. Moreover, a comprehensive qualitative analysis compares the proposed studies in each application area in terms of their advantages, disadvantages, and main contributions.

This study was conducted to quantify the restoration progress for approximately 30 year old plantation plots of Acacia and Pterocarpus in Sakaerat, Thailand. For 22.5 × 22.5 m areas in the plantation plots, as a continuous measure of forest restoration, dry evergreen forest-likelihood was determined using 45 cm resolution satellite images and an artificial neural network architecture. The Acacia plot achieved a moderate mean evergreen forest likelihood of 0.451 (April 2016) to 0.679 (May 2019), but the values for the Pterocarpus plot were 0.076 or smaller. Two other Pterocarpus plots at cooler and moister sites had mean evergreen forest-likelihood values of up to 0.884 (April 2016), which were significantly greater than that (0.451) for the Acacia plot, but the values dropped in May 2019. Throughout the period of the four image acquisition times from March 2014 to May 2019, the plantation plots had significantly smaller evergreen forest-likelihood than the dry evergreen forest did.

As earlier studies have focused mainly on productivity in conventional banks rather than Islamic banks, the current study aims to bridge the gap in the literature by investigating both types of bank in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. A total of 385 Islamic and conventional banks from 18 countries were selected, with data acquired for the period from 2008 to 2017. Panel data analysis was undertaken using DEA-based MPI to investigate the impact of selected determinants of banks’ productivity, as indicated by TFPCH. The results from both the t-test and nonparametric tests revealed that Islamic banks are more productive than conventional banks, which can be attributed to the increase in efficiency changes. However, no statistically significant difference in productivity exists between the types of bank. The main contribution of this study is that it provides not only corroboration for previous studies but also additional insight into bank productivity in Islamic and conventional banks, which will be important to banks, regulators, investors, and researchers. © 2020 Conscientia Beam.",Conventional banks; Islamic banks; Malmquist productivity index; Middle east; South asia; Southeast asia; Total factor productivity change,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098276523

This environment can cause a wide range of metabolic and fetal cardiac structural alterations. Fetal myocardial hypertrophy predominantly affecting the interventricular septum possesses a morphology of disarray similar to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and may be present in some GDM neonates after birth. Myocardial thickness may increase in GDM fetuses independent of glycemic control status and fetal weight. Fetal echocardiography performed on fetuses with GDM helps in assessing cardiac structure and function, and to diagnose myocardial hypertrophy. There are few studies in the literature which have established evidence for morphologic variation associated with cardiac hypertrophy among fetuses of GDM mothers. In this study, fetal ultrasound images of normal, pregestational diabetes mellitus (preGDM) and GDM mothers were used to develop a computer aided diagnostic (CAD) tool. We proposed a new method called local preserving class separation (LPCS) framework to preserve the geometrical configuration of normal and preGDM/GDM subjects. The generated shearlet based texture features under LPCS framework showed promising results compared with deep learning algorithms. The proposed method achieved a maximum accuracy of 98.15% using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Hence, this paradigm can be helpful to physicians in detecting fetal myocardial hypertrophy in preGDM/GDM mothers. © 2013 IEEE.",computer-aided diagnosis; Fetal myocardial hypertrophy; gestational diabetes mellitus; local preserving class separation; ultrasound images,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097929648

In contrast to traditional merchant ships, unmanned merchant ships have great advantages in economy, society, and safety. However, we observe that commercial applications of unmanned ships are still at an exploratory stage. We believe that unmanned merchant ships will be widely adopted and popular in the near future. There is a need to have a good survey of current technologies, foundation, and obstacles of implementation of future unmanned merchant ships. Such a survey is beneficial to ship builders, researchers, owners, and students. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of ship structure and technology, navigation, automation, algorithms, communication, Internet of Things (IOT), etc. We introduce traditional ships and analyze the role of crew and navigation operations on board.

However, in viewer's perspective, it is sometimes difficult to know where the conventional gesture cue (Hands-in-Air style: HiA) refers to because the conventional HiA gesture appears away from the distant object. In this paper, we investigate how two factors, distance to the object and view angle difference between collaborators, influence the understanding of HiA gesture by comparing the use of it at 25 positions with 5 distances and 5 view angles. In a user study, we found that the distance to the target object and view angle difference negatively influenced HiA gesture communication. The influence of the distance and view angle was more serious between smaller angles (030 degree) than larger angles (3060 degree), and between shorter distances (1m ? 1.5m ) than between longer distance (1.5m ? 2m ). As a solution, we propose the Hands-on-Target (HoT) style which positions the hand gesture cue on the surface of the target object. The HoT style gesture cue dramatically reduces the negative effect of the distance and view angle difference. Participants completed the task 29.3 percent faster, selected the correct object 2.75 times more, and felt 63.1 percent less mental effort. For further investigation, we discuss on the extensibility of the HoT interface that it can be used not only for object selection but also for diverse type of gesture communication including gesture for object manipulation because the HoT interface can support all possible real world hand gestures. © 2013 IEEE.",Augmented reality; collaboration; mixed reality; virtual reality,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097923449

Specifics of communication for AGVs and AMRs imposes stringent performance requirements on latency and reliability of communication links which many existing wireless technologies struggle to satisfy. In this paper, a review of latest AGVs and AMRs research results in the past decade is presented. The review encompasses results from different past and present research domains of AGVs.

Due to the limited healthcare infrastructure and the lack of trained human resources, the CKD problem aggravates if it is not addressed in its earlier stages. In this regard, the role of machine learning-based automated diagnosis systems plays a vital role to deal with the CKD problem. In most of the studies conducted on the automated CKD decision modeling, the main emphasis is given to enhancing the predictive accuracy of the system. In this study, we focus on the applicability challenges of automated decision systems taking CKD diagnosis as a case study within the purview of developing countries. In this regard, we propose a cost-sensitive ensemble feature ranking method that takes a more realistic approach to group-based feature selection. Two candidate solutions are proposed for group-based feature selection to meet different objectives. Subsequently, both the candidate solutions are combined into a consolidated solution. It is pertinent to note that it is one of the first studies in which cost-sensitive ensemble feature ranking for non-overlapping groups is successfully demonstrated to achieve the stated objectives i.e. low-cost and high-accuracy solution. Based on an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective and accurate solution for the CKD problem can be obtained. The experimentation includes 7 well-known classification algorithms and 8 comparative feature selection methods to show the efficacy of the proposed approach. It is concluded that the applicability of the automated CKD systems can be enhanced by including the cost consideration into the objective space of the solution formulation. Therefore, a trade-off solution can be obtained that is cost-effective and yet accurate enough to serve as a CKD screening system. © 2020 IEEE.",cost-based feature selection; Ensemble feature ranking; filter methods; threshold selection,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097820459

However, such purchase behavior has received limited attention from the research community in emerging markets. This study aims at investigating the factors behind vacation home purchase behavior and helping identify potential buyers. Specifically, factors, such as air quality, enduring involvement, place attachment, and destination familiarity, are examined via a proposed integrative model, which links these factors to purchase intention. The total number of potential buyers of vacation homes is increasing but remains small, compared to the whole consumers' population, resulting in imbalanced purchase behavior data when validating a model. To address this problem, this study proposes an autoencoder-enabled and k -means clustering-based (AKMC) method to identify potential buyers. The proposed methods tested on a dataset of 309 samples, collected through a questionnaire-based survey, and achieves a model accuracy of 82% in identifying potential buyers, outperforming other traditional machine learning methods, such as decision trees and support vector machines.

This not only negatively impacts the company’s service quality but also causes user safety issues. In this study, a mechanism for the rebalancing of useable bikes and faulty bikes is presented in two steps: 1) gathering each faulty bike at a station determined by the model traversing the shortest path by light service vehicles; and 2) enabling the rebalancing operation to obtain optimal bike inventory levels at all stations and collect faulty bikes at a depot. The destination station from which each faulty bike is taken is considered a decision variable rather than shifting them to a closer station. The mechanism is based on minimizing the total cost of the rebalancing operation by optimizing the formulated problem, supported by time and capacity constraints.

For the answer, this paper develops a novel analytical framework, primarily by applying the concept of the global value chain to robotisation. By doing this, we investigate in detail the entire robotisation chain, from robotics developers over robot manufacturers to companies that deploy the industrial robots. For the R&D-intensive part of the chain (robotics development), we analyse robotics patent data from PATSTAT combined with firm data from ORBIS while for the capital-intensive part (deployment of robots) the source of information is the International Federation of Robotics. Our results show that the European robotisation landscape is fragmented into three groups. The first includes economies (Sweden, Germany, Austria, Denmark and France) that have the highest densities both in robotics development and in robot deployment. Countries of the second group (Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland) possess good positions only in some specific parts of the chain, while the lagging behind region (the majority of Central and Eastern Europe) is integrated into the robotisation chain solely by robot deployment.

Distributed generators that are supplied by intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) are being connected to the grids. As RES get cheaper, more customers are opting for peer-to-peer energy interchanges through the smart metering infrastructure. Consequently, power management in grid-tied RES-based microgrids has become a challenging task. This paper reviews the applications of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in managing power in grid-tide microgrids. Unlike other optimization methods such as numerical and soft computing techniques, RL does not require an accurate model of the optimization environment in order to arrive at an optimal solution. In this paper, various challenges associated with the control of power in grid-tied microgrids are described. The application of RL techniques in addressing those challenges is reviewed critically. This review identifies the need to improve and scale multi-agent RL methods to enable seamless distributed power dispatch among interconnected microgrids. Finally, the paper gives directions for future research, e.g., the hybridization of intrinsic and extrinsic reward schemes, the use of transfer learning to improve the learning outcomes of RL in complex power systems environments and the deployment of priority-based experience replay in post-disaster microgrid power flow control. © 2013 IEEE.",Electric vehicle charging station; energy management; Markov decision process; microgrid; reinforcement learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097347819

In order to avoid the prematurity of the algorithm, the perturbation mechanism is added, i.e., the three-point insertion method is used in the crossover stage.

As a result, a new paradigm named Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is born. In SIoT, social network merges with the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate information and resource sharing among devices in an improved way. Devices seek and provide information among their friends or friends-of-friends. However, the users of this fascinating paradigm meet with issues such as trust and privacy. Hence, trust assessment becomes one of the primary challenges. Existing trust assessment schemes in SIoT are mostly based on the trust of a service provider. The application of such schemes is related to the process of service discovery. However, the ability of a service to act maliciously is overlooked. Literature from related fields shows that services are also capable of acting maliciously. Inspired by that, we aim to define a trustworthiness assessment scheme that is based on trust of service. The application of this scheme is related to the process of service selection. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel proposition in SIoT. A parameter named Service Trust is proposed. This parameter is mathematically modeled by aggregation of multiple Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. A real-world bike-sharing company dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed scheme. The results attained after analysis are positive. Finally, the conclusion and future work are presented. © 2013 IEEE.",Quality of Service (QoS); service discovery; service selection; service trust; Social Internet of Things (SIoT); Social networks; trust; trust assessment,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097344469

Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports.

The KH algorithm, since inception, has generated considerable real-world application interests in the research community. The standard algorithm solution implementation steps follow the initialization mechanism, which relies mainly on educated guesses or random initialization solution generation. Therefore, to improve the performance of the KH algorithm, the current study is set to investigate the influence of initializing the KH algorithm with three low-discrepancy sequences, such as the Faure sequence, Sobol sequence, and Van der Corput sequence. These low-discrepancy sequences are known to be more uniformly distributed across the problem search space than the commonly used random number initialization method. The study also evaluates the influence of population size on the performance of the proposed variants of the improved KH algorithms. The experimental results show significant improvements for the enhanced KH algorithms in terms of performance and the quality of solutions obtained; particularly on standard benchmarked high-dimension test problem instances, where the enhanced KH variants outperformed the existing basic KH algorithm for all the test functions evaluated. Similarly, the results for low dimension test cases showed less sensitivity to the initialization schemes, as the performance of our proposed improved scheme was comparable to that of the basic KH algorithm. However, in most cases, as the problem dimension was scaled up, the enhanced KH outperformed the basic KH. Evaluation results based on the population size of the algorithm, revealed that when the number of Krill is set at 25, the Sobol based KH initialization scheme performed better than did the other methods. Although, the Van der Corput and Faure based KH initialization schemes showed similar sensitivity when the dimension was set at 20. As we varied the population size of Krill, it was observed that the performance of the Sobol based KH initialization scheme deteriorated, whereas the other two methods showed superior performance. Overall, the findings from this study revealed that there are significant improvements in the performance of KH algorithm when initialized with low-discrepancy sequences. © 2013 IEEE.",faure sequence; initialization of metaheuristics; Krill herd algorithm; low-discrepancy sequence; sobol sequence; van der caput sequence,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096834209

The workers are prone to severe fatal accidents due to unavailability of permanent firefighting system in many construction sites, thus they typically rely on portable firefighting equipment (PFE) to minimize fire damage. Many occupational health and safety agencies have developed safety regulations for PFE installation and monitoring in construction. However, in the traditional construction fire safety management process, the installation spots for PFE's are visually identified in a 2D floor plan and then top-down supervisory approach is used to inspect the active availability of the PFE's. Such manually operated conventional methods of PFE installation and monitoring are expensive, prone to manipulation, and do not provide sufficient motivation for voluntarily following fire safety policies. Therefore, this research study develops a fire safety rule-based PFE installation approach and proposes an alternative method for shifting the top-down inspection approach to the bottom-up voluntarily approach for convenient, transparent, and automated safety inspection information delivery. To validate the bottom-up approach concept, a visual language algorithm is initially developed for PFE installation planning system (PFE-IPS) in BIM, followed by an optical character recognition (OCR) and blockchain -based android application for safety inspection information system (SIIS). This article also presents two case studies to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the developed systems. The proposed approach out-turn reduces the safety manager's manual efforts and burdens of government safety auditors while enhancing efficiency and reliability. © 2013 IEEE.",BIM; blockchain; Fire safety rule; optical character recognition (OCR); portable firefighting equipment (PFE); visual languages,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096820830

However, the clinical utility and usability from the perspectives of clinicians is largely unexplored. Objective: This study aimed to explore clinician perspectives on the use of wearable cardiac monitoring technology for older adults. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted using semistructured focus group interviews. Clinicians were recruited through purposive sampling of physicians, nurses, and allied health staff working in 3 tertiary-level hospitals. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis to identify themes. Results: Clinicians representing physicians, nurses, and allied health staff working in 3 tertiary-level hospitals completed 4 focus group interviews between May 2019 and July 2019. There were 50 participants (28 men and 22 women), including cardiologists, geriatricians, nurses, and allied health staff. The focus groups generated the following 3 overarching, interrelated themes: (1) the current state of play, understanding the perceived challenges of patient cardiac monitoring in hospitals, (2) priorities in cardiac monitoring, what parameters new technologies should measure, and (3) cardiac monitoring of the future, “the ideal device.” Conclusions: There remain pitfalls related to the design of wearable cardiac technology for older adults that present clinical challenges. These pitfalls and challenges likely negatively impact the uptake of wearable cardiac monitoring in routine clinical care. Partnering with clinicians and patients in the co-design of new wearable cardiac monitoring technologies is critical to optimize the use of these devices and their uptake in clinical care. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

The analysis variables are the Won, Yuan, Yen spot exchange rates and international financial market variables. The results of the analysis are as follows: First, there was a long-term cointegration relationship between RMB, KRW, JPY and international financial market variables. Second, the analysis results of the VECM showed that explanatory power of Korea's offshore Won-Dollar accounts for 50% of the onshore Won-Dollar. The results of the analysis of the Yuan's VECM showed that the onshore Yuan (CNY) and offshore Yuan (CNH) exchange influence, but each has its own independent characteristics. Overall, the Won is more integrated with the international financial market than the Yuan. The Yen's relationship with variables in the international financial market was stronger than that of the Won and the Yuan. Third, offshore Won-Dollar, onshore KRW, and JPY had similar Granger causality relationship and impulse responses with international financial market variables. However, CNH and CNY indicated weaker than that of Won and Yen. The onshore Won-Dollar is shown to partially offset the shock from the onshore Yuan and offshore Yuan. The implications of this study are as follows: First, it is important to look at the exchange rate from the perspective of the international financial market. Second, Yuan investment and risk management are necessary considering the characteristics of the onshore and offshore Yuan which are interrelated but also distinctly unique markets. Third, it is necessary to manage the exchange rate position, taking into account the long-term equilibrium relationship among the Won, Yuan, and Yen currencies.

This concern is more prominent in developing countries due to the scarcity of resources. This book provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion on the distributive pattern of out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenditures under the health reforms in Turkey and makes comparisons with pharmerging countries. Turkey's health reforms began in 2003 to address shortcomings related to financial protection and to improve health outcomes and the quality of healthcare services. The primary motivation was to ensure equity in the distribution of health resources, and this transformation process led to profound changes in how these resources were used, and in health financing in general. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the long-term effect of health reforms on the distribution patterns of health expenditures and health service use. This book offers a thorough equity analysis of the health financing system, affected by this health transformation program. Index and curve approaches are used in the equity analysis of pharmaceutical expenditures. The book examines the long-term effects of health system regulations on the health spending characteristics of households and improves the current understanding of equity in this context. It includes extensive international comparisons of healthcare services across a range of developing countries and highlights the significance of ensuring equity for emerging economies. The author explores the existing evidence as well as future research directions and provides policy and planning advice for health policymakers to contribute to establishing a more equal health system design.

In order to minimize the total operation cost and maximize the system reliability, a semi-continuous model for the shuttle tanker scheduling problem is established. The model optimizes the tanker scheduling plan and the design of the tanker fleet. To solve the complex model, this article proposes an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with differential evolution operator to solve the optimization of the multi-objective model.

The overall pollution status of organic micropollutants (OMPs) and metals in the groundwater and corresponding health risks are unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to comprehensively screen for and assess the health risks of OMPs and metals in groundwater of rural areas in China where groundwater is used for drinking so as to provide a benchmark for monitoring and improving groundwater quality in future developments. METHODS: One hundred sixty-six groundwater samples were collected in the rural areas of China, and 1,300 OMPs and 25 metals were screened by GC-MS, LC-QTOF/MS, and ICP-MS analysis. To assess the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of the detected pollutants, missing toxicity threshold values were extrapolated from existing databases or predicted by quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to account for uncertainties in the exposure parameters and toxicity thresholds. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-three OMPs and 25 metals were detected from the 166 samples. The concentration summation for the detected OMPs ranged from 2.9 to 1:7 × 105 ng=L among the different sampling sites. Cumulative noncarcinogenic risks for the OMPs were estimated to be negligi-ble. However, high metal risks were calculated in 23% of the sites. Forty-two carcinogens (including 38 OMPs) were identified and the cumulative carcinogenic risks in 34% of the sites were calculated to be &gt;10–4 (i.e., one excess cancer case in a population of 10 thousand people). The carcinogenic risks were estimated to be mainly associated with exposures to the metals, which were calculated to contribute 79% (0–100%) of the cumulative carcinogenic risks. DISCUSSION: The overall status of OMPs and metals pollution in the groundwater and the corresponding health risks were determined preliminarily, which may provide a benchmark for future efforts in China to ensure the safety of drinking water for the local residents in rural areas. The joint application of QSARs and Monte Carlo simulation provided a feasible way to comprehensively assess the health risks of the large and ever-increasing number of pollutants detected in the aquatic environment. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6483. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Therefore, in the assessment of suppliers, their environmental performance should be taken into consideration along with other criteria for supplier selection. Raising awareness of sustainability in production and conservation and protection of the environment is very important both for the whole environment and for the company itself by increasing its competitive advantage. And, one of the steps to achieve this is for the companies to try to select green suppliers. So, the purpose of this study is to raise awareness and tackle the need for green supplier selection and, using multiple-criteria decision-making models, to elaborate a case study regarding this. A survey was conducted in a manufacturing firm. The data were analysed, and fuzzy MCDM (multicriteria decision-making) methods and artificial neural networks were implemented. Fuzzy methods are the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP), fuzzy TOPSIS, and fuzzy ELECTRE. ANN supports the result of fuzzy MCDM models from the profit side. ANN can make the best estimate of the current year based on historical data. Fuzzy MCDM methods will also find good solutions using the available data but will produce different solutions as there are different decision-making methods. It is aimed to produce a synergy from the solutions obtained here and to produce a better solution. Instead of a single method, it would be more accurate to produce a better solution than the solution provided by all of them.

During recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success and are widely applied in RSI scene classification. However, crafted images that serve as adversarial examples can potentially fool CNNs with high confidence and are hard for human eyes to interpret. For the increasing security and robust requirements of RSI scene classification, the adversarial example problem poses a serious problem for the classification results derived from systems using CNN models, which has not been fully recognized by previous research. In this study, to explore the properties of adversarial examples of RSI scene classification, we create different scenarios by testing two major attack algorithms (i.e., the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and basic iterative method (BIM)) trained on different RSI benchmark datasets to fool CNNs (i.e., InceptionV1, ResNet and a simple CNN). In the experiment, our results show that CNNs of RSI scene classification are also vulnerable to adversarial examples, and some of them have a fooling rate of over 80%. These adversarial examples are affected by the architecture of CNNs and the type of RSI dataset. InceptionV1 has a fooling rate of less than 5%, which is lower than the others. Adversarial examples generated on the UCM dataset are easier than other datasets. Importantly, we also find that the classes of adversarial examples have an attack selectivity property. Misclassifications of adversarial examples of RSIs are related to the similarity of the original classes in the CNN feature space. Attack selectivity reveals potential classes of adversarial examples and provides insights into the design of defensive algorithms in future research. © 2013 IEEE.",adversarial example; convolutional neural network; deep learning; Remote sensing image,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092502915

The explosive growth of mobile data has led to an increased demand for solutions that conserve storage resources. Data deduplication is a promising technique that eliminates data redundancy for storage. For mobile cloud storage services, enabling the deduplication of encrypted data is of vital importance to reduce costs and preserve data confidentiality. However, recently proposed solutions for encrypted deduplication lack the desired level of security and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for serverless efficient encrypted deduplication (SEED) in mobile cloud computing environments. Without the aid of additional servers, SEED ensures confidentiality, data integrity, and collusion resistance for outsourced data. The absence of dedicated servers increases the effectiveness of SEED for mobile cloud storage services, in which user mobility is essential. In addition, noninteractive file encryption with the support of lazy encryption greatly reduces latency in the file-upload process. The proposed indexing structure (D-tree) supports the deduplication algorithm and thus makes SEED much more efficient and scalable. Security and performance analyses prove the efficiency and effectiveness of SEED for mobile cloud storage services. © 2020 Youngjoo Shin et al.",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091985586

However, the influence of the fourth industrial revolution environment on the destination reputation, pre-visit experience, visit intentions and how these affect tourists’ satisfaction and loyalty intentions have not received much attention, especially within the African context. Aim: The purpose of this study was to empirically test the effect of this environment on all these variables. Setting: This study is one of the few empirical types of research conducted in an urban tourism destination centre in a South African context. Methods: The study employed a positivist quantitative research methodology. Primary data (N = 235) were collected from tourists who visited the Vilakazi Street precinct during October–November 2019, using the convenient probability sampling approach. For analysis, the study employed structural equation modelling. Results: There are positive relationships between the fourth industrial revolution environment and the online reputation and the pre-visit experience. These, in turn, have a positive effect on the intention to visit the precinct, which affects the tourists’ feelings of satisfaction after actually visiting the centre. Satisfaction has a positive impact on their loyalty intentions. Conclusion: The findings create a space for future research by providing another framework for investigating the usefulness of new technology in the tourism industry, which can also extend to other industries. For managers, the findings can help in the creation of online advertisement strategies, online reputation management and online pre-visit experience enhancement. © 2020. The Authors.

The aim of the research is to analyze the dynamics of vegetation of territories of the four provinces in Central Iraq using the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI in the period from 2014 to 2017. The objects of the research are territories of Central Iraq: Babil, Baghdad, Wasit and Diyala. The subject of the study is temporal-territorial variability of vegetation state. Methods: remote sensing, thematic mapping, image processing, spatial data analysis, statistical analysis. Results. Patterns of temporarily-territorial dynamics of vegetation state in Central Iraq were revealed using vegetation index NDVI calculated with remote sensing data obtained by Landsat-8. Regional features of the vegetation structure and the rate of its state change were established. The maximum areas of non-vegetated territories were found in Baghdad and Wasit; covered by vegetation of most classes – also in Wasit; covered by dense vegetation – in Diyala, marked as well by minimum of barren areas. Babil is characterized by minimum area covered by vegetation. Baghdad in the studied indicators is intermediate. These patterns are poorly consistent with the absolute values of the province areas. They are caused by the prevailing economic conditions and are manifested in the qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the distribution of vegetation in the provinces. During the active stage of vegetation, from February to March, the variations in areas of non-vegetated territories, occupied by moderate and dense vegetation, are stable. At the same time, the variability of areas of territories with very dense vegetation is growing, with weak vegetation and vegetation of maximum density decreases. A correlation analysis between NDVI values and weather conditions did not reveal any significant relationships. © 2020 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

It identifies deviations in budget and schedule, aids project managers in taking earlier corrective actions against cost and schedule overruns. Although the literature highlights the significance of scope by adopting it as a leading indicator to measure project success or failure. However, EVM does not include scope when evaluating the performance of any software project. While considering the importance of scope and its ever-changing nature, it is imperative to measure the effect of changes in scope on the project plan. To analyse such effects, this study aims to enhance the traditional EVM by incorporating scope into it. The main objectives of this paper are: i) to extract the effects of project scope changes, ii) to map extracted effects of project scope changes with Software Project Scope Rating Index (SPSRI) elements, and iii) to quantify the extracted effects and integrate them with EVM. An extensive literature review is conducted to achieve the first objective, which results in the seventeen unique effects; that were used to map with SPSRI elements. To forecast the variations in scope for a given project budget, Monte Carlo simulations were run on the top eight scope elements, whereas, the results were incorporated with EVM to identify the deviations between actual and projected values of scope's score and cost. Finally, the multivariate regression model was used to evaluate the influence of individual element on the overall estimated cost of the project. The correlation between the independent variables (SPSRI elements) and the dependent variable (overall cost) was calculated along with the valuation of each independent variable on the dependent variable. Moreover, the effects are statistically shown that independent variables have influenced the dependent variable. This technique could assist the project managers to forecast deviations in project scope earlier. © 2013 IEEE.",Earned value management; Monte Carlo simulations; project monitoring and controlling; software project scope rating index,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090935214

Unlike the classical OPDP, in the SDOPDPSTRP: the demands can be split and must be transported along the shortest path according to passengers requirements and vehicles should travel along a real-life path. A new kind of integer programming model is formulated for the SDOPDPSTRP based on the connection relationship between pickup-delivery demands (pd-pairs). Two different categories of splitting strategies are proposed to solve the SDOPDPSTRP: split the demands before the calculation and split the demands during the calculation. Two Multi-Start Variable Neighborhood Descent (a MS_VND originating from the other literature and a new MS_VND' IN developed in this article) and seven neighborhood operators are proposed for these two splitting strategies to solve the SDOPDPSTRP. The results show that Approach III outperforms Approach I and Approach II in terms of average solutions with the same algorithm termination conditions and in terms of time efficiency, which has great practical significance for real-life transport organizations. © 2013 IEEE.",Gurobi solver; integer programming; multi-start; One-to-one pickup and delivery problem; real-life connected graph; shortest-path transport; split demand; variable neighborhood descent,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090758393

However, non-physical interaction using visual devices such as laser pointers has gained less attention than physical interaction using complex robots such as humanoids. Such vision-based interaction has high potential for use in recent human-robot collaboration environments such as assembly guidance, even with a minimum amount of configuration. In this paper, we introduce a simple robotic laser pointer device that follows an arbitrary planar path and is designed to be a visual instructional aid. We also propose an image-based automatic path generation method using reinforcement learning and a sequential pattern reduction technique. However, such vision-based human-robot interaction is generally performed in a dynamic environment, and it can frequently be necessary to calibrate the devices more than once. In this paper, we avoid the need for this re-calibration process through episodic randomization learning and improved learning efficiency. In particular, contrary to previous approaches, the agent controls the curriculum difficulty in a self-directed manner to determine the optimal curriculum. To our knowledge, this is the first study of curriculum learning that incorporates an explicit learning environment control signal initiated by the agent itself. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that the proposed self-directed curriculum learning method outperforms ordinary episodic randomization and curriculum learning. We hope that the proposed method can be extended to a general reinforcement learning framework. © 2013 IEEE.",curriculum learning; deep reinforcement learning; Path generation; robotic laser pointer,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090324374

The high-resolution CHIRPS data showed the closest agreement with the IMD precipitation and well captured the drought characteristics. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) identified seven major droughts events during the period of 1981 to 2016. Appropriate calibration and validation were performed for drought forecasting using the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The forecasting result showed a reasonably good agreement with the observed datasets with the one-month lead time.

The main objective of this study is to accurately map the areas prone to gully erosion, by developing two machine learning (ML) models, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) models within 4-fold cross-validation (CV). Moreover, we used the multi-collinearity analysis to select 11 variables among 15 conditioning factors to train the ML models for gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM). Lamerd county, Iran, is chosen for a study area because Lamerd county is one of the most affected areas by gully erosion in this country. From 232 gully samples, 75% was used to train the two ML models and the rest of the samples (25%) were used to validate the generated GEMSs using 4-fold CV. The RF model produced a higher accuracy with an accuracy value of 93%. The GEMS generated by the RF model shows that the areas classified as highly vulnerable and very highly vulnerable are 1,869 ha and 5,148 ha, respectively. Results from the two models indicated that the most vulnerable land use/landcover class is bare land because of the low vegetation cover. The outcome of this study can help managers in Lamerd county to mitigate the soil erosion problem and prevent future gully erosion by taking preventive measures. © 2020 The Author(s).

Each subproblem can be solved by appropriate algorithm according to its physical properties. In the MID method, the individuals carry out their own optimal operation strategies to maximize self-interests while information privacy and independent operation of system participants are protected. Furthermore, optimal energy market clearing prices, which guarantee the maximization of social welfare, are obtained in this method. When market transaction prices deviate from the optimal prices, there will be a marked decline in the benefit of the whole system. © 2013 IEEE.",distributed method; integrated energy systems; modeling and optimization; Multi-individual,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089603800

In other words, a single IoT device/node that gets infected with malware has the potential to spread the malicious activities across the network, eventually ceasing the network functionality or compromising the network. Simply detecting and quarantining the malware in IoT networks does not guarantee preventing malware propagation. On the other hand, use of traditional control theory for malware confinement is not effective, as most of the existing works do not consider real-time malware control strategies that can be implemented using uncertain infection information from the nodes in the network or have the containment problem decoupled from network performance. In response, in this work, we propose a two-pronged approach with malware detection at node-level, and confinement of malware at network-level. We deploy a recently proposed lightweight runtime malware detector at the node-level that employs Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) values for malware detection. This node-level malware information is combined with the malware propagation information and then fed during runtime to a stochastic predictive controller to confine the malware propagation without hampering the network performance. Synthesizing the node-level malware information with the model predictive containment strategy leads to achieving an average network throughput of nearly 200% of that of IoT network without any defense, and up to 160% of that of network with commonly employed state-of-the-art heuristic approaches for malware confinement. Furthermore, to scale with ever-increasing network topology sizes, we introduce a novel multi-attribute graph translation that can predict the network topology and node state information when provided with a snapshot of topology and node-level malware infection. The proposed multi-attribute graph translation has <5.88 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the model predictive containment strategy and has shown nearly constant graph translation time and limited resource utilization independent of the network size. © 2013 IEEE.",control theory; malware confinement; malware detection; Malware epidemics; the IoT security,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089568696

GPC platforms are not specifically designed to efficiently execute NFs with their typically intense Input/Output (I/O) demands. Recently, numerous hardware-based accelerations have been developed to augment GPC platforms and infrastructures, e.g., the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, to efficiently execute NFs. This article comprehensively surveys hardware-accelerated platforms and infrastructures for executing softwarized NFs. This survey covers both commercial products, which we consider to be enabling technologies, as well as relevant research studies. We have organized the survey into the main categories of enabling technologies and research studies on hardware accelerations for the CPU, the memory, and the interconnects (e.g., between CPU and memory), as well as custom and dedicated hardware accelerators (that are embedded on the platforms); furthermore, we survey hardware-accelerated infrastructures that connect GPC platforms to networks (e.g., smart network interface cards). We find that the CPU hardware accelerations have mainly focused on extended instruction sets and CPU clock adjustments, as well as cache coherency. Hardware accelerated interconnects have been developed for on-chip and chip-to-chip connections. Our comprehensive up-to-date survey identifies the main trade-offs and limitations of the existing hardware-accelerated platforms and infrastructures for NFs and outlines directions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.",Central processing unit (CPU); hardware accelerator; interconnect; memory; software defined networking (SDN); virtualized network function (VNF),Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089502667

However, little is known as to how these methodologies are used in practice. In particular, the question of whether data mining methodologies are used 'as-is' or adapted for specific purposes, has not been thoroughly investigated. This article addresses this gap via a systematic literature review focused on the context in which data mining methodologies are used and the adaptations they undergo. The literature review covers 207 peerreviewed and 'grey' publications. We find that data mining methodologies are primarily applied 'as-is'. At the same time, we also identify various adaptations of data mining methodologies and we note that their number is growing rapidly. The dominant adaptations pattern is related to methodology adjustments at a granular level (modifications) followed by extensions of existing methodologies with additional elements. Further, we identify two recurrent purposes for adaptation: (1) adaptations to handle Big Data technologies, tools and environments (technological adaptations); and (2) adaptations for context-awareness and for integrating data mining solutions into business processes and IT systems (organizational adaptations). The study suggests that standard data mining methodologies do not pay sufficient attention to deployment issues, which play a prominent role when turning data mining models into software products that are integrated into the IT architectures and business processes of organizations. We conclude that refinements of existing methodologies aimed at combining data, technological, and organizational aspects, could help to mitigate these gaps. © 2020 Plotnikova et al.",CRISP-DM; Data mining; Data mining methodology; Literature review,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089349787

As the current pandemic has affected countries socially and economically, the purpose of this bibliometric analysis is to provide a holistic review of the corona pandemic in the field of social sciences. This study aims to highlight significant, influential aspects, research streams, and themes. We have reviewed 395 journal articles related to coronavirus in the field of social sciences from 2003 to 2020. We have deployed 'biblioshiny' a web-interface of the 'bibliometrix 3.0' package of R-studio to conduct bibliometric analysis and visualization. In the field of social sciences, we have reported influential aspects of coronavirus literature. We have found that the 'Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report' is the top journal. The core article of coronavirus literature is 'Guidelines for preventing health-care-associated pneumonia'. The most commonly used word, in titles, abstracts, author's keywords, and keywords plus, is 'SARS'. Top affiliation is 'The University of Hong Kong'. Hong Kong is a leading country based on citations, and the USA is on top based on total publications. We have used a conceptual framework to identify potential research streams and themes in coronavirus literature. Four research streams are found by deploying a co-occurrence network. These research streams are 'Social and economic effects of epidemic disease', 'Infectious disease calamities and control', 'Outbreak of COVID 19,' and 'Infectious diseases and the role of international organizations'. Finally, a thematic map is used to provide a holistic understanding by dividing significant themes into basic or transversal, emerging or declining, motor, highly developed, but isolated themes. These themes and subthemes have proposed future directions and critical areas of research. © 2013 IEEE.",Bibliometric analysis; biblioshiny; conceptual structure; coronavirus; COVID survey; COVID-19; pandemic; r-studio; SARS; social sciences,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089310056

However, considering the clinical significance, the diagnosis of severity stage is more important and single HRI cutoff may not be enough. Also, the segmentation of Liver/Kidney area should be automatic to get rid of operator subjectivity from ultrasonography analysis. Method: Double-layered Fuzzy C-Means (DFCM) pixel clustering method is proposed to extract the target area of analysis automatically. HRI and other shape related variables of Liver intensity distribution such as the skewness, the kurtosis, and the coefficient of variance (CV) are automatically computed for the fatty liver severity stage classification. Result: From fifty ultrasound images obtained from regular health checkup with 24 normal, 12 mild, 11 moderate, 3 severe stage determined by three different radiologists, the proposed DFCM automatically extracts the region of interests(ROI) and generates a set of statistically significant variables including HRI, the skewness, the kurtosis, the coefficient of variance of liver intensity distribution as well as liver echogenicity. In severity stage classification, the echogenicity of the liver and distribution shape variables such as the skewness and the kurtosis are better predictors than HRI based on our simple decision tree learning analysis. Conclusion: For better diagnosis of fatty liver severity stages, we need better set of features than the single HRI cutoff. Better machine learning structures are necessary in this severity stage classification problem with automatic segmentation method proposed in this paper. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

However, this new discourse that attracts the attention of human resource management specialist globally faces obstacles from dissatisfied employees who are comfortable with old practices. This paper proposes the model of Exit, Voice, Loyalty, and Neglect (EVLN) as a manifestation of employees communicative responses in reacting to dissatisfaction within the Indonesian public sector setting. Path analysis is used to fit the data provided by 150 public university lecturers. The results reveal two dominant clusters: first, those who will stay in the organization but demonstrate withdrawal behaviorssuch as pretending to be sick, showing up late, putting little effort intotheir work, and frequently not to attend official meetings (neglect) and the second, those who will remain confident, assume that in the end, everything will be all right andpatiently wait and expect for betterment (loyalty). This brings the implication that in most cases, the most significant constraint to a new model is a non-technical, in the management category, such as internal employee resistance. To overcome the obstacle, public sectors require effective, knowledgeable leaders who can help spur bureaucratic action, and implement strategies that promote sustainable change. © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

It has become necessary to predict PC in order to improve power management and co-operation between the energy used in a building and the power grid. State-of-the-art Energy Consumption Prediction (ECP) methods are limited in terms of predicting the energy effectively, due to various challenges such as weather conditions and the dynamic behaviour of occupants. Thus, to overcome the drawbacks of these methods, we present an intelligent hybrid technique that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Multi-layer Bi-directional Long-short Term Memory (M-BDLSTM) method using three steps. When applied to short-term power ECP, this approach helps to provide efficient power management i.e. it can assist the supplier to produce the optimum amount of power. The first step in our proposed method integrates the pre-processing and data organisation mechanisms to refine the data and remove abnormalities. The second step employs a deep learning network, where the sequence of refined data is fed into the CNN via the M-BDLSTM network to learn the sequence pattern effectively. The third step generates the ECP/PC by comparing actual and predicted data series and evaluates the prediction using error metrics. The proposed method achieves better prediction results than existing techniques, thus demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, it achieved the smallest value of the Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for individual household dataset using 10-fold Cross Validation (CV) and a hold-out (CV) method. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; bi-directional LSTM; CNN; deep learning; power consumption; short-term energy consumption,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088701184

Therefore, when an application handles security-sensitive data, it is highly recommended to run the application in a trusted execution environment. In response to this demand, hardware-based trusted execution environments such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone have been developed in commodity computers. However, hardware-based approaches cannot be quickly upgraded to address design vulnerabilities or to reflect customer feedback. In this paper, we propose SofTEE, a software framework to support a trusted execution environment for user applications. For a trusted execution environment, SofTEE should support memory isolation and attestation. For memory isolation, SofTEE relies on kernel deprivileging which delegates the execution of privileged operations such as memory management, from a kernel to a special module called a security monitor. To reduce the overhead of switching between the deprivileged kernel and the security monitor, SofTEE proposes an efficient management mechanism of the address space identifier. SofTEE supports attestation by assuming minimal hardware functionalities of random entropy and root of trust. The main challenge of SofTEE is to guarantee security properties like confidentiality and integrity of security-sensitive applications. For security analysis, we have identified security invariants that SofTEE should meet for confidentiality and integrity guarantees. Based on the security invariants, we have designed and prototyped each component of SofTEE on a Raspberry Pi 3 board. SofTEE produces about 3% overhead in case of a security-sensitive application with long execution time and 23% overhead in case of a security-sensitive application with short execution time. © 2013 IEEE.",Address space identifier; kernel deprivileging; trusted execution environment,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088641111

Present research methods in this domain do not explicitly distinguish the contexts of a test utterance in a meaningful way while classifying emotions in conversations. In this paper, we propose a model, named different contextual window sizes based recurrent neural networks (DCWS-RNNs), to differentiate the contexts. The model has four recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that use different contextual window sizes. These window sizes can represent the implicit weights of different aspects of contexts. Further, four RNNs are independently to model the different aspects of contexts into memories. Such memories with the test utterance are then merged using attention-based multiple hops. Experiments show DCWS-RNNs outperforms the compared methods on both the IEMOCAP and AVEC datasets. Case studies on the IEMOCAP dataset also demonstrate that our model has excellent performance to capture the emotional dependent utterance that is most relevant to the test utterance and assigned to the highest attention score. © 2013 IEEE.",contextual window sizes; emotion detection; Interactive conversations; multimodal; recurrent neural network,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088288055

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may improve access and reduce the financial burden for DR screening while maintaining comparable or enhanced clinical effectiveness. To deploy an AI-based DR screening program in a real-world setting, it is imperative that health economic assessment (HEA) and patient safety analyses are conducted to guide appropriate allocation of resources and design safe, reliable systems. Few studies published to date include these considerations when integrating AI-based solutions into DR screening programs.

Big data have started to demonstrate significant values in higher education. This paper gives several contributions to the state-of-the-art for Big data in higher education and learning technologies research. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey or literature review for Big educational data. Most literature reviews from a few authors have focused on one of these fields: educational mining, learning analytics with discussions on one or two aspects such as Big data technologies without educational focus, social media data in education, etc. Most of these literature reviews are short and insufficient to provide more inclusive reviews for Big educational data.

The basic Reproduction number (R0) (for the next generation matrix) was derived to estimate the transmission of the novel COVID-19 using the simplified BHRP transmission network model. The logic estimates that around 2.30 persons could be affected by the reservoir and around 3.58 persons could be affected by the community (individual person to community population). On the other hand, the concise model based on real-time time-dependent data, such as day-to-day number of tests, appreciates the initiatives (control measures) of the Chinese government to break the transmission chain of the pandemic in the capital city of Hubei province. Furthermore, the basic Reproduction number (R0) for India is reviewed to be in the range between 1.4 and 3.9 using the classical SIR model and thus, the transmission rate is the same as that of California and Washington. The review also outlines the epidemiological SIR model (based on real-time time-dependent data) which estimates about the equilibrium stage of t he pandemic by the last week of May, 2020. The predictions of the age-structured epidemiological SIR model could be more accurate if data such as day-to-day number of tests are correctly fed during evaluation of the results.

Through this empathy, humans derive aesthetic satisfaction. Psychological studies on art and emotions have been extensively conducted since the 20th century, and it has been found that artistic activities such as painting and writing have a positive effect on human emotions. However, it is difficult for a non-professional painter to express human emotions in a picture using artistic elements. The aim of this study was to propose a 'user emotion-inspired painterly rendering process' to help non-professionals reflect their emotions through painting. To accomplish this aim, a painter-rendering system that automatically creates digital paintings with parameterized painting features was used. We analyzed the correlation between human emotions and the rendering parameters affecting the painting style through a user study, and we estimated the rendering parameter values for specific emotions. The results showed that colors and emotions were closely linked, and color scheme was an influential factor in the paintings. Furthermore, we developed a recoloring algorithm based on Kobayashi's three color systems classified as human emotions, and we created paintings that better reflect specific emotions. The proposed algorithm was validated through a user satisfaction survey. Hence, the proposed system can improve a user's understanding of painting and create paintings that reflect specific emotions. © 2013 IEEE.",Affective computing; emotion analysis; image stylization; painterly rendering; recoloring,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087169997

The XGBoost integrates the superiority of statistical and machine learning methods, which can flexibly deal with the nonlinear data in high-dimensional space and quantify the relative importance of the explanatory variables. The data collected from the Washington Incident Tracking System in 2011 are used in this research. To investigate the potential philosophy hidden in data, K-means is chosen to cluster the data into two clusters. The XGBoost is built for each cluster. Bayesian optimization is used to optimize the parameters of XGBoost, and the MAPE is considered as the predictive indicator to evaluate the prediction performance. A comparative study confirms that the XGBoost outperforms other models.

More specifically, Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder methods were employed to identify unknown attacks using flow features. In the experiments carried out, the flow-based features extracted out of network traffic data, including typical and different types of attacks, were used.

It lacks standard spelling and hence poses several normalization challenges during automatic language processing. In this article, we present a feature-based clustering framework for the lexical normalization of Roman Urdu corpora, which includes a phonetic algorithm UrduPhone, a string matching component, a feature-based similarity function, and a clustering algorithm Lex-Var. UrduPhone encodes Roman Urdu strings to their pronunciation-based representations. The string matching component handles character-level variations that occur when writing Urdu using Roman script. The similarity function incorporates various phonetic-based, string-based, and contextual features of words. The Lex-Var algorithm is a variant of the k-medoids clustering algorithm that groups lexical variations of words. It contains a similarity threshold to balance the number of clusters and their maximum similarity. The framework allows feature learning and optimization in addition to the use of predefined features and weights. We evaluate our framework extensively on four real-world datasets and show an F-measure gain of up to 15% from baseline methods. We also demonstrate the superiority of UrduPhone and Lex-Var in comparison to respective alternate algorithms in our clustering framework for the lexical normalization of Roman Urdu. © The Author(s), 2020.

The deployment of emerging technologies allows OG companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the OG industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of OG-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the OG industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the OG industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the OG industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the OG industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the OG industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the OG industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the OG industry is still at an early stage. © 2013 IEEE.",digital twin (DT); Digitalization; extended reality; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); industry 4.0; oil and gas,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086449098

The conceptual model was validated using partial least squares structural equation modeling with data collected from 255 key informants from public sector organizations. Empirical results show that clear communication, coercive pressure, expected benefit, good governance, mimetic pressure, normative pressure, and organizational size have a significant influence on the adoption of EA by public sector organizations. Surprisingly, top management support, ICT infrastructure, EA complexity, organizational readiness, and external support have a nonsignificant influence on EA adoption by public sector organizations. The implications of the findings are also discussed in theoretical, contextual, and practical aspects of EA adoption in the context of public sector organizations. This model facilitates decision-makers in focusing only on the significant factors in the organizational and environmental context that influence EA adoption in Malaysian public sector organizations.

This study suggests a conceptual model of medical tourism service supply chain (MTSSC) to provide a clearer understanding of its nature, and defines its business processes. Design/methodology/approach: Triangulation which makes use of literature review, in-depth interviews, and expert evaluations was applied to develop and validate the suggested model. The proposed model is initialized based on the relevant literature. In-depth interviews were used to refine and finalize the model. Expert evaluations ensure the trustworthiness of the model and the business process definitions. Findings: The proposed model uses a nested process structure rather than a one-dimensional supply chain model, where the assistance company maintains an intermediary role between the patient and all the service providers (e.g. medical institutions, transportation, accommodation). Additionally, the conceptual model identifies seven business processes: service design, service recovery management, customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, demand management, capacity and resource management, and service delivery management. Practical implications: The results provide a better understanding of the MTSSC structure and processes, and a recognition of the MTSSC members. The process definitions give the members an idea about their roles in the service design and delivery in practice. Additionally, a better understanding of the system as a whole leads to better process development and control. MTSSC members may shape their organizations internally and supply chain-wide by considering this conceptual model. Moreover, the model acts as a basis for supply chain collaboration decisions. Originality/value: The conceptual model is built upon the theories and practice of medical tourism services, supply chain management, and service operations management.

Given that building energy consumption constitutes a significant portion of the overall grid load, building energy management is a critical component for the DR portfolio. In this study, DR control policies for lighting and air-conditioner systems for the individual spaces in buildings are proposed. The policies are designed to achieve the energy reduction amount specified in the DR request while minimizing the user discomfort. A significant challenge is to cope with the uncertainty of various environmental factors such as the solar illuminance and ambient temperature, as well as the psycho-economic factors such as the energy usage preferences of the occupants. We employ a data-driven machine learning approach to tackle this challenge. Our novel idea is to take advantage of the structural similarity of the control policies across the spaces in a lifelong multi-task learning framework. To accommodate significant nonlinearity in efficient policies, a kernel-based learning approach is pursued. The dual decomposition method is employed to relax the constraint coupled across the spaces, which allows solving the overall learning problem via a series of unconstrained subproblems.

Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers about its applicability in various applications. © 2013 IEEE.",Blockchain; consensus algorithms; cyber-physical systems; intelligent transportation; IoT; smart grid; supply chain management,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084927004

As such, it attempts to model the tourism demand in the Philippines, which is a relatively underrepresented area in the literature, despite its tourism sector’s growing economic progress. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid support vector regression (SVR) – seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages (SARIMA) model is proposed to model the seasonal, linear and nonlinear components of the tourism demand in a destination country. The paper further proposes the use of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches in selecting the best forecasting model among a set of considered models. As such, a preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) II is used to rank the considered forecasting models. Findings: The proposed hybrid SVR-SARIMA model is the best performing model among a set of considered models in this paper using performance criteria that evaluate the errors of magnitude, directionality and trend change, of a forecasting model. Moreover, the use of the MCDM approach is found to be a relevant and prospective approach in selecting the best forecasting model among a set of models. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in several aspects. First, this paper pioneers the demonstration of the SVR-SARIMA model’s capability in forecasting long-term tourism demand. Second, this paper is the first to have proposed and demonstrated the use of an MCDM approach for performing model selection in forecasting. Finally, this paper is one of the very few papers to provide lenses on the current status of Philippine tourism demand. © 2020, Dharyll Prince Mariscal Abellana Donna, Marie Canizares Rivero, Ma.

However, rapidly declining groundwater levels in the aquifer and increasing pumping costs pose challenges for sustainability of irrigated cotton production in this region. Adoption of efficient irrigation strategies, such as terminating irrigation at an appropriate time in the growing season, could enable producers to increase irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) while maintaining desired yield goals. The objective of this study was to determine optimum irrigation termination periods for cotton production in the THP under full and deficit irrigation conditions using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Cotton model, which was evaluated in a prior study in the THP using measured data from an IWUE field experiment at Halfway, Texas. The treatment factors in the field experiment included irrigation capacities of 0 mm d-1 (low, L), 3.2 mm d-1 (medium, M), and 6.4 mm d-1 (high, H), applied during the vegetative, reproductive, and maturation growth stages. This study focused on a full irrigation (HHH) treatment and three deficit irrigation (LMH, LHM, and LMM) treatments. Eight irrigation termination dates with a one-week interval between 15 August and 30 September were simulated, and the impact of irrigation termination date on cotton IWUE and seed cotton yield were studied by dividing the 39-year (1978 to 2016) simulation period into dry, normal, and wet years based on the precipitation received from 1 April to the simulated irrigation termination date. Results indicated that the simulated IWUE was consistently higher under the LHM, LMH, and LMM treatments when compared to the HHH treatment. Based on the simulated average seed cotton yield and IWUE, optimum irrigation termination periods for cotton were found to be the first week of September (about 118 days after planting, DAP) for the HHH and LMH treatments and the second week of September (125 DAP) for the LHM and LMM treatments in normal years. In wet years, optimum irrigation termination periods were a week earlier than those in normal years and a week later in dry years for the HHH, LHM, and LMM treatments. For the LMH treatment, the optimum irrigation termination period in wet years was the same as that in normal years and two weeks later in dry years. The results from this study along with field-specific, late-season information will assist THP cotton producers in making appropriate irrigation termination decisions for improving economic productivity of the Ogallala Aquifer and thereby ensuring water security for agriculture. However, the recommendations from this study should be used with caution, as the optimum irrigation termination periods could potentially change with changes in cultivar characteristics, soil type, climate, and, crop management practices. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

In this area, sandbars are recently observed with lots of arguments about the causes and regimes of formation. This could very likely result of not reliable source of information on shoreline evolution and a lack of historical monitoring data. Accurately identification of shoreline positions over a given period of time is a key to quantitatively and accurately assessing the beach erosion and accretion. The study is therefore to propose an innovative method of accurately shoreline positions for an analysis of coastal erosion and accretion in the Cua Dai estuary. The proposed technology of multitemporal remote sensing and digital evaluation model with tidal correction are used to analyse the changes in shoreline and estimate the rate of erosion and accretion. An empirical formula is, especially, exposed to fully interpret the shoreline evolution for multiple scales based on a limitation of satellite images during 1965 to 2018. The results show that there is a significant difference of shoreline shift between corrections and non-corrections of tidal. Erosion process tends to be recorded in the Cua Dai cape located in the Cua Dai ward, especially in the An Luong cape located in the Duy Hai commune with the length of 1050 m. Furthermore, it is observed that there is much stronger erosion in the north side compared with south side of Cua Dai estuary. © 2019 by the authors.",Cua dai; Erosion; Shoreline evolution; Tidal correction; Tidal level,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084519997

This is due to low electrification rates in many of the countries in SSA. A hybrid energy system for power generation combines various energy systems, either renewable or a combination of renewable and fossil-powered sources for optimal power extraction and operation. In the era of decarbonization of the electricity grid through the use of renewable energy, hybridization of sources is an essential condition for the production of electricity. Based on current quest for renewable energy (RE) expansion in the global energy mix, optimum conditions for the production and adoption of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) at micro-levels are indispensable and must be advocated for. This can be justified based on the perpetually rising cost of energy for socio-economic development. This paper presents a survey of major issues regarding the motivations and specific benefits behind the adoption of HRES. Also presented, is a discussion on different renewable energy sources that can be adopted for HRES application for both grid and off-grid consumers. Furthermore, a discussion on the important issues as it pertains to the design and implementation of HRES is also presented.

Recently, various studies have been conducted based on reinforcement learning to optimally control the hybrid electric vehicle. In fact, the fundamental control approach of reinforcement learning shares many control frameworks with the control approach by using deterministic dynamic programming or stochastic dynamic programming. In this study, we compare the reinforcement learning based strategy by using these dynamic programming-based control approaches. For optimal control of hybrid electric vehicle, each control method was compared in terms of fuel efficiency by performing simulation by using various driving cycles. Based on our simulations, we showed the reinforcement learning-based strategy can obtain global optimality in the optimal control problem with an infinite horizon, which can also be obtained by stochastic dynamic programming. We also showed that the reinforcement learning-based strategy can present a solution close to the optimal one using deterministic dynamic programming, while a reinforcement learning-based strategy is more appropriate for a time variant controller with boundary value constraints. In addition, we verified the convergence characteristics of the control strategy based on reinforcement learning, when transfer learning was performed through value initialization using stochastic dynamic programming. © 2013 IEEE.",Dynamic programming; hybrid electric vehicle; optimal control; power management; reinforcement learning,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084123392

This has generated an enormous amount of travel-based data in the form of reviews, blogs, and ratings. However, most recommendation systems only recommend the top-rated places. Along with the top-ranked places, we aim to discover places that are often ignored by tourists owing to lack of promotion or effective advertising, referred to as under-emphasized locations. In this study, we use all relevant data, such as travel blogs, ratings, and reviews, in order to obtain optimal recommendations. We also aim to discover the latent factors that need to be addressed, such as food, cleanliness, and opening hours, and recommend a tourist place based on user history data. In this study, we propose a cross mapping table approach based on the location's popularity, ratings, latent topics, and sentiments. An objective function for recommendation optimization is formulated based on these mappings. The baseline algorithms are latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that the combined features of LDA, SVM, ratings, and cross mappings are conducive to enhanced performance.

The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies.

Therefore, it's critical for us to analyse affecting factors and study the propagation characteristics of malware. On the basis of the difference of intelligent device's dissemination capacity and discriminant ability, a dynamic malware propagation model (Disseminate&Discriminate-Spread-Exposed-Ignorant-Recover, DDSEIR) is proposed. First, intelligent devices are classified into different groups according to the level of dissemination capability by hierarchical mechanism, which takes the networks topology into account. And subsequently, intelligent device's discriminant ability can be evaluated by sender's identity and information attributes. Then, the mean field equation is constructed to analyze the dynamic characteristics of DDSEIR and the factors that influence malware propagation, which is used to further derive the malware propagation scale and threshold value of diffusion. Finally, this paper uses Live Journal dataset to verify the effectiveness of DDSEIR.

However, a data mining involving query can cause privacy problems by disclosing both the data and the query. One task in data mining, classification, is used in a wide range of applications, and we focus on k -nearest neighbor (k NN) in this study to realize classification. Although several studies have already attempted to address the privacy problems associated with k NN computation in a cloud environment, the results of these studies are still inefficient. In this paper, we propose a very efficient and privacy-preserving k NN classification (PkNC) over encrypted data. While the amount of computation (encryptions/decryptions and exponentiations) and communication of the most efficient k NN classification proposed in prior studies is bounded by O(kln) , that of the proposed Pk NC is bounded by O(ln) , where l is the domain size of data and n is the number of data. When conducting experiments with the same dataset, the prior k NN classification took 12.02 to 55.5 minutes but Pk NC took 4.16 minutes. Furthermore, since Pk NC allows to be carried out in parallel for each data, its performance can be improved extremely if it is carried out on machine to allow more numerous threads. Pk NC protects the privacy of dataset, input query including the k NN result, and does not disclose any data access patterns. We propose several protocols to serve as building blocks to construct Pk NC and formally prove their security. In particular, we propose efficient protocols that privately find k largest or smallest elements in array. © 2013 IEEE.",cloud computing; k-nearest neighbor classification; privacy-preserving data mining,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083699235

The processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising alternative to reduce the overhead caused by data movement. Many studies have been conducted on the utilization of the PIM taking advantage of the bandwidth increased by the through silicon via (TSV). One approach is to design an optimized PIM architecture for a specific application, the other is to find the tasks that will be more advantageous when offloading to PIM. The goal of this paper is to make the PIM, a newly introduced technology, be easily applied to various applications. The programmable GPU-based PIM is the target system. The essential but simple task offloading conditions are proposed to secure as many candidate tasks as possible when there is any potential benefit from the PIM. The PIM design options then are explored reflecting the characteristics of the candidate tasks actively. When determining offloading conditions, it is difficult to simultaneously consider three time-energy-power objectives. Thus, the problem is divided into two sub-problems. The first offloading condition is designed based on time-energy constraints, whereas the second offloading condition is modeled to satisfy time-power constraints. During the whole processes, the offloading conditions and the PIM design options are carefully configured in a complementary manner to reduce the tasks that are excluded from the offloading. In the simulation results, the suitability of the modeled two offloading conditions and the proposed PIM design are verified using various benchmarks and then, they are compared with previous works in terms of processing speed and energy. © 2013 IEEE.",High bandwidth memory; near-data-processing; processing-in-memory; task offloading,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083236974

Recently, there has been a strong interest in executing RNNs on embedded devices. However, difficulties have arisen because RNN requires high computational capability and a large memory space. In this paper, we review existing implementations of RNN models on embedded platforms and discuss the methods adopted to overcome the limitations of embedded systems. We will define the objectives of mapping RNN algorithms on embedded platforms and the challenges facing their realization. Then, we explain the components of RNN models from an implementation perspective. We also discuss the optimizations applied to RNNs to run efficiently on embedded platforms. Finally, we compare the defined objectives with the implementations and highlight some open research questions and aspects currently not addressed for embedded RNNs. Overall, applying algorithmic optimizations to RNN models and decreasing the memory access overhead is vital to obtain high efficiency. To further increase the implementation efficiency, we point up the more promising optimizations that could be applied in future research.

The nature of LS-IoT networks requires robust and scalable MAC protocols to manage concurrent, dynamic and massive media access and resource allocation. Several reviews have been conducted on MAC protocols with a handful of them focused on LS-IoT networks or massive M2M networks. In this paper, the characterisation of LS-IoT networks and the MAC component are extensively discussed delineating the impact of LS-IoT on the MAC. Emerging research issues on the MAC for LS-IoT networks including high collision probability, high control overheads, spectrum constraints, timing constraints, hardware constraints, energy consumption and hidden terminals are discussed.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) for the arithmetic of approximate numbers scheme enables efficient arithmetic evaluations of encrypted data of real numbers, which encourages to develop privacy-preserving machine learning training algorithm. In this study, we propose an HE-friendly algorithm for the SVM training phase which avoids inefficient operations and numerical instability on an encrypted domain. The inference phase is also implemented on the encrypted domain with fully-homomorphic encryption which enables real-time prediction. Our experiment showed that our HE-friendly algorithm outperformed the state-of-the-art logistic regression classifier with fully homomorphic encryption on toy and real-world datasets.

The academia community later willingly joined the discussion on usability in terms of theory and empirical measurement, having experience and knowledge in desktop settings. At first sight, such a background should guarantee a solid foundation to conduct research on software usability in a new setting. However, a preliminary study on the subject matter revealed methodological disorder in contemporary literature. As a matter of fact, a need emerged to review existing usability definitions, attributes and measures to recognize all associated aspects. In order to fill this void, we conducted a systematic literature review on usability studies indexed by the Scopus database and devoted to mobile applications. The input volume covers 790 documents from 2001 to 2018. The data analysis shows that the ISO 9241-11 usability definition has been adopted in an unchanged form and popularized as the standard by the HCI community. Secondly, in total, 75 attributes were identified and analysed. The most frequent are efficiency (70%), satisfaction (66%) and effectiveness (58%), which directly originate from the above definition. Subsequently, the less frequent are learnability (45%), memorability (23%), cognitive load (19%) and errors (17%). The last two concern simplicity (13%) and ease of use (9%). Thirdly, in the evaluation of usability, controlled observation and surveys are two major research methods applied, while eye-tracking, thinking aloud and interview are hardly used and serve as complementary to collect additional data. Moreover, usability evaluations are often confused with user experience dimensions, covering not only application quality characteristics, but also user beliefs, emotions and preferences. All these results indicate the need for further research on the usability of mobile applications, aiming to establish a consensus in the theory and practice among all interested parties. © 2013 IEEE.",attributes; measures; Mobile applications; systematic literature review; usability; usability evaluation methods,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082712187

First, to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, we introduce a GAN model based on the game between convergence speed and solution quality. Then, to overcome premature convergence, an adaptive stagnation avoidance strategy is proposed. The strategy consists of two parts: (1) information entropy. It is used to measure the diversity of GAACO; (2) a cooperative game model. When the value of information entropy is less than threshold value, the cooperative game model will be used to select the appropriate pheromone matrix for different colonies to improve the accuracy. Finally, to further accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, the initial pheromone matrix is preprocessed to increase the pheromone of the optimal path for each iteration in the early stage. And according to reinforcement learning method, each colony increases the pheromone of the global optimal path at the end of each iteration. Extensive experiments with numerous instances in the TSPLIB standard library show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art multi-colony ant colony optimization algorithms, especially in the large-scale TSPs. © 2013 IEEE.",cooperative game; Generative adversarial nets; information entropy; travel salesman problem,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082623256

The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various applications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low production cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation, autonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in sensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the IoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the Internet. Hence, the security of IoT should start with foremost securing WSNs ahead of the other components. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e., there is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the flowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big concern to the scientific community. More specifically, for the application areas in which CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) has prime importance, WSNs and emerging IoT technology might constitute an open avenue for the attackers. Besides, recent integration and collaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms of security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these systems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks. Therefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along with the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks are provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated into mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are investigated under that umbrella: 'Passive Attacks' and 'Active Attacks'. Understanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help paving a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT technology. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",6LowPAN; 6LowPSec; 6TiSCH; Blockchain; CoAP; cryptography; detection; DoS; intrusion; IoT; MQTT; prevention; RPL; survey; TSCH; WSN,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082167051

The objective of this paper is to examine the paradigm shifts in EE approaches in recent times by reviewing traditional approaches to EE, analyzing recent trends, and identifying future challenges and opportunities. Considering the current energy concerns, nodes in emerging wireless networks range from limited-energy nodes (LENs) to high-energy nodes (HENs) with entirely different constraints in either case. In view of these extremes, this paper examines the principles behind energy-efficient wireless communication network design. We then present a broad taxonomy that tracks the areas of impact of these techniques in the network. We specifically discuss the preponderance of prediction-based energy-efficient techniques and their limits, and then discuss the trends in renewable energy supply systems for future networks. Finally, we recommend more context-specific energy-efficient research efforts and cross-vendor collaborations to push the frontiers of energy efficiency in the design of wireless communication networks. © 2020 Joshua Onyeka Ogbebor et al.",,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082166315

To deal with the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images from various CBCT scanners, we used a histogram-based method as a preprocessing step to estimate the average gray density level of the bone and tooth regions.

IoT nodes equipped with smart sensors can immediately extract meaningful knowledge from the data through machine learning technologies. Deep learning (DL) is constantly contributing significant progress in smart sensing due to its dramatic superiorities over traditional machine learning. The promising prospect of wide-range applications puts forwards demands on the ubiquitous deployment of DL under various contexts. As a result, performing DL on mobile or embedded platforms is becoming a common requirement. Nevertheless, a typical DL application can easily exhaust an embedded or mobile device owing to a large amount of multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations and memory access operations. Consequently, it is a challenging task to bridge the gap between deep learning and resource-limited platforms. We summarize typical applications of resource-limited deep learning and point out that deep learning is an indispensable impetus of pervasive computing. Subsequently, we explore the underlying reasons for the high computational overhead of DL through reviewing the fundamental concepts including capacity, generalization, and backpropagation of a neural network. Guided by these concepts, we investigate on principles of representative research works, as well as three types of solutions: algorithmic design, computational optimization, and hardware revolution. In pursuant to these solutions, we identify challenges to be addressed. © 2020 Chunlei Chen et al.",,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082101802

However, significant variations, process uncertainties, negative influence of external environment and insufficient use of unlabeled data always cause the attenuation of prediction performance. Thus, this paper proposed an adaptive semi-supervised multi-output soft-sensor by co-training recursive heterogeneous models. In the proposed strategy, a linear multi-output model, called recursive partial least square (MRPLS), and a nonlinear multi-output, called long short-term memory recurrent neural network (MLSTM), are co-trained to deal with inefficient use of label data adaptively. Ensemble of both models are not only able to address the linear and nonlinear hybrid behaviors in different time scale, but also able to deal with multiple tasks learning issues. In addition, the model proposed an odd-even grouping strategy to equalize two parts of the labeled data, which is able to capture the global variations of a process. To validate the prediction performance of the proposed soft-sensor, it was verified through a simulation benchmark platform (BSM1) and a real sewage treatment plant (UCI database). The results meant that co-training MRPLS-MLSTM achieved better performance compared with other existing co-training models in terms of the hard-to-measure variables. © 2013 IEEE.",co-training; long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM); multi-output; recursive partial least square (RPLS); semi-supervised; Soft-sensors,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082091203

Standardized conformance testing mechanisms are widely used to test software applications, including IoT applications. However, current conformance testing mechanisms require continuous human intervention and additional software to be embedded into a target device being tested, which is time consuming, costly, and requires additional memory on the target device. Therefore, there is a considerable need to enhance and optimize existing conformance testing so that it is adequate for automatically testing highly distributed constraint IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for automated and scalable conformance testing for IoT applications by introducing a test triggering mechanism based on a standardized test interface. This triggering mechanism is based on several new logical components in a testing environment that exchange messages between a testing system and a target IoT device. This technique of automatic conformance testing can lessen the cost and human intercession to decrease the number of missteps and accelerate the IoT market by certifying IoT applications. © 2013 IEEE.",Conformance testing; Internet-of-Things (IoT); Interoperability; OneM2M standards; Testing automation,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082077164

These attacks target the conversion process from a physical quantity to an analog property - a process that fundamentally cannot be authenticated. Out-of-band signal injection attacks thus pose previously-unexplored security risks by exploiting hardware imperfections in the sensors themselves, or in their interfaces to microcontrollers. In response to the growing-yet-disjointed literature in the subject, this article presents the first survey of out-of-band signal injection attacks. It focuses on unifying their terminology and identifying commonalities in their causes and effects through a chronological, evolutionary, and thematic taxonomy of attacks. By highlighting cross-influences between different types of out-of-band signal injections, this paper underscores the need for a common language irrespective of the attack method. By placing attack and defense mechanisms in the wider context of their dual counterparts of side-channel leakage and electromagnetic interference, this study identifies common threads and gaps that can help guide and inform future research. Overall, the ever-increasing reliance on sensors embedded in everyday commodity devices necessitates that a stronger focus be placed on improving the security of such systems against out-of-band signal injection attacks. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",attacks and defenses; hardware imperfections; mixed-signal systems; Out-of-band; signal injections; survey,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082015195

A study to establish weeds associated with sorghum and their management was conducted in two sorghum-growing districts, Insiza and Chipinge, during the 2016/17 cropping season. Physical weed sampling in farmers’ fields was done to identify weeds infesting sorghum. A questionnaire was used to collect survey data from 80 respondents who were randomly selected. Physical weed sampling established that the dominant weeds that infested sorghum in the two districts were Amaranthus hybridus, Richardia scabra, Tagetes minuta, Striga asiatica, Commelina benghalensis, Eleusine indica, Datura stramonium and Panicum spp. Many of the weeds are broadleaf species, offering opportunity to harness sorghum allelopathy for weed control. Allelopathic compounds exuded by sorghum, such as sorgoleone, have been proven to largely suppress broadleaf weeds.  There has been little change in the weed spectrum in sorghum when results of the current study are compared to benchmark national weed survey of arable lands of the smallholder farms of Zimbabwe conducted in 1988. This indicates possibility of high persistence of the soil seedbank. The majority of farmers in the two districts (85%) controlled weeds by hand weeding, indicating a very limited shift towards adopting alternative weed management technologies since 1990 when an inventory of weed science technological needs for communal farmers was compiled. Smallholder sorghum growers may need to broaden their weed management strategies in order to overcome some of the challenges that are associated with hand weeding. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

A large number of servers run at a low utilization rate, which results in a great waste of power. To save more energy in a cloud data center, we propose an energy-efficient task-scheduling mechanism with switching on/sleep mode of servers in the virtualized cloud data center. The key idea is that when the number of idle VMs reaches a specified threshold, the server with the most idle VMs will be switched to sleep mode after migrating all the running tasks to other servers. From the perspective of the total number of tasks and the number of servers in sleep mode in the system, we establish a two-dimensional Markov chain to analyse the proposed energy-efficient mechanism. By using the method of the matrix-geometric solution, we mathematically estimate the energy consumption and the response performance. Both numerical and simulated experiments show that our proposed energy-efficient mechanism can effectively reduce the energy consumption and guarantee the response performance. Finally, by constructing a cost function, the number of VMs hosted on each server is optimized. © 2020 Chunxia Yin et al.",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081181616

Conclusions: According to our results, the most relevant forums are the Empirical Software Engineering and Information and Software Technology journals, and the Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement conference. We observed that, as in previous reviews by other researchers, most of the studies were carried out by European institutions, especially Italian, Spanish, and German researchers and institutions. The studies attracting more citations were published mainly in journals and in the International Conference on Software Engineering. Testing, requirements, and software construction were the most frequent topics of replication studies, whereas the usual empirical method was the controlled experiment. On the other hand, we identified research gaps in areas such as software engineering process, software configuration management, and software engineering economics.

In this paper, we propose novel RUL prediction techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM). To estimate RUL even in the presence of capacity regeneration phenomenon, we consider multiple measurable data from battery management system such as voltage, current and temperature charging profiles whose patterns vary as aging. Unlike the traditional LSTM prediction that matches input layer with output layer as one-to-one structure, we leverage many-to-one structure to be flexible for various input types and to substantially reduce the number of parameters for better generalization. Using the NASA lithium-ion battery datasets, we verify the accuracy of the proposed LSTM-based RUL prediction.

Furthermore, the proposed multi-channel LSTM model significantly improves the MAPE, e.g., by 63.7% compared to the baseline; the proposed model achieves 0.47-1.88% of MAPE while the state-of-the-art baseline LSTM shows 0.6-6.45% of MAPE. © 2020 IEEE.",capacity estimation; Lithium-ion battery; long short-term memory; remaining useful life,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081107148

This study mapped 7 nonmaterial-intangible cultural ES (NICE) valuations of 34 rural farmers in western Taiwan using the Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) methodology, to show the effect of farming practices on NICE valuations. However, rather than a direct causal relationship between the environmental characteristics that underpin ES, and respondents' ES valuations, we found that environmental data is not explanatory enough for causality within a socio-ecological production landscape where one type of land cover type (a micro mosaic of agricultural land cover) predominates. To compensate, we used a place-based approach with Google Maps data to create context-specific data to inform our assessment of NICE valuations. Based on 338 mapped points of 7 NICE valuations distributed among 6 areas within the landscape, we compared 2 groups of farmers and found that farmers' valuations about their landscape were better understood when accounting for both the landscape's cultural places and environmental characteristics, rather than environmental characteristics alone. Further, farmers' experience and knowledge influenced their NICE valuations such that farm areas were found to be sources of multiple NICE benefits demonstrating that farming practices may influence ES valuation in general. © 2020 by the authors.",Agroecosystem services; Context-specific; Farmers; Local; Organic farming; Rural; Socio-ecological production landscape,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079808714

Recent advances in technological innovations and genetics and the growing availability of health data have set a new pace of the research and impose a set of new requirements on the different stakeholders. Some studies are available that discuss about the different aspects of PM. Nevertheless, a holistic representation of those aspects deemed to confer with the technological perspective, in relation to the applications and challenges, have been mostly ignored. In this context, this paper surveys the advances in PM from the informatics viewpoint and reviews the enabling tools and techniques in a categorized manner. In addition, the study discusses how other technological paradigms, which include big data, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things, can be exploited to advance the potentials of PM. Furthermore, the paper provides some guidelines for future research for a seamless implementation and a wide-scale deployment of PM based on the identified open issues and the associated challenges. As a result, the paper proposes an integrated holistic framework for PM motivating informatics researchers to design their relevant research work in an appropriate context. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; big data; bioinformatics; clinical decision support; deep learning; informatics; machine learning; Precision medicine; the Internet of Things,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079804832

The input of the ERT comprised 39 propositions from 20 experts representing 11 different perspectives. The two-day ERT discussed the main drivers and challenges as well as vulnerabilities or unseens and provided suggestions for (i) the mechanisms underlying major unseens; (ii) understanding possible ways in which rebound effects of digital transformation may become the subject of overarching research in three main categories of impact: development factors, society, and individuals; and (iii) a set of potential action domains for transdisciplinary follow-up processes, including a case study in Brazil. A content analysis of the propositions and related mechanisms provided insights in the genesis of unseens by identifying 15 interrelated causal mechanisms related to critical issues/concerns. Additionally, a cluster analysis (CLA) was applied to structure the challenges and critical developments in South America. The discussion elaborated the genesis, dynamics, and impacts of (groups of) unseens such as the digital divide (that affects most countries that are not included in the development of digital business, management, production, etc. tools) or the challenge of restructuring small-and medium-sized enterprises (whose service is digitally substituted by digital devices). We identify specific issues and effects (for most South American countries) such as lack of governmental structure, challenging geographical structures (e.g., inclusion in high-performance transmission power), or the digital readiness of (wide parts) of society.

However, framing resilient and correct smart contracts (SCs) for these smart application is a quite challenging task because of the complexity associated with them. SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed.

Performance of these four methods was evaluated to select the best method for flash flood susceptibility mapping. In the model studies, ten flash flood conditioning factors, namely soil, slope, curvature, river density, flow direction, distance from rivers, elevation, aspect, land use, and geology, were chosen based on topography and geo-environmental conditions of the site. For the validation of models, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Area Under Curve (AUC), and various statistical indices were used. The results indicated that performance of LMT model is the best among the four methods (LMT: AUC = 0.988; KLR: AUC = 0.985; RBFC: AUC = 0.984; and NBM: AUC = 0.983).

In this paper, a new classification scheme is proposed for automatic food-ingredient recognition based on deep learning. We construct an up-to-date combinational convolutional neural network (CBNet) with a subnet merging technique. Firstly, two different neural networks are utilized for learning interested features. Then, a well-designed feature fusion component aggregates the features from subnetworks, further extracting richer and more precise features for image classification. In order to learn more complementary features, the corresponding fusion strategies are also proposed, including auxiliary classifiers and hyperparameters setting. Finally, CBNet based on the well-known VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet is evaluated on a dataset including 41 major categories of food ingredients and 100 images for each category. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that CBNet achieves promising accuracy for multi-class classification and improves the performance of convolutional neural networks. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

Some of these technologies are very location specific while others require high upfront costs. Photovoltaic (PV) generation has become the rising star of this pack, thanks to its versatility. It can be implemented with very little upfront costs, e.g., small solar home systems, or large solar power plants can be developed to generate MWs of power. In contrast with wind or tidal generation, PV can be deployed all around the globe, albeit with varying potentials. These merits have made PV the renewable energy technology with highest installed capacity around the globe. However, PV penetration into the grid comes with its drawbacks. The inverter-interfaced nature of the PV systems significantly impacts the power system operation from protection, power flow and stability perspectives. There must be strategies to mitigate these negative impacts so that PV penetration into the grid can continue.

A computer system capable of recognizing human emotion from the body can also significantly change the way we interact with the computers. One of the significant challenges is to identify emotion-specific features from a vast number of descriptors of human body movements. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-layer feature selection framework for emotion classification from a comprehensive list of body movement features. We used the feature selection framework to accurately recognize five basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and neutral. In the first layer, a unique combination of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was utilized to eliminate irrelevant features. In the second layer, a binary chromosome-based genetic algorithm was proposed to select a feature subset from the relevant list of features that maximizes the emotion recognition rate. Score and rank-level fusion were applied to further improve the accuracy of the system. The proposed system was validated on proprietary and public datasets, containing 30 subjects. Different action scenarios, such as walking and sitting actions, as well as an action-independent case, were considered. Based on the experimental results, the proposed emotion recognition system achieved a very high emotion recognition rate outperforming all of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed system achieved recognition accuracy of 90.0% during walking, 96.0% during sitting, and 86.66% in an action-independent scenario, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness of the developed method. © 2013 IEEE.",biometrics; Emotion recognition; feature selection; gait analysis; genetic algorithm; human motion; information fusion; kinect sensor,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078708938

A low-complexity pan-sharpening method is proposed to employ not only panchromatic images, but also multi-spectral images for enhancing the performance of the deep neural network. The high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) images are then fed into the proposed feature-level U-Net. The proposed feature-level U-Net consists of two-stages: a feature-level subtracting network and U-Net. The feature-level subtracting network is used to extract dynamic difference images (DI) for the use of low-level and high-level features. By employing this network, the performance of change detection algorithms can be improved with a smaller number of layers for U-Net with a low computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm detects small changes by taking benefits of both geometrical and spectral resolution enhancement and adopting an intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) pan-sharpening method. A modified of IHS pan-sharpening algorithm is introduced to solve spectral distortion problem by applying mean filtering in high frequency. We found that the proposed change detection on HRMS images gives a better performance compared to existing change detection algorithms by achieving an average F-1 score of 0.62, a percentage correct classification (PCC) of 98.78%, and a kappa of 61.60 for test datasets. © 2013 IEEE.",change detection; Convolutional neural network; deep learning; remote sensing; satellite images,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078704591

The universities are located in different geographical areas and collaboration among these universities is difficult and this makes accessibility to data and information resource of the universities a problem. As a result quite a number of knowledge built from these resources are locally managed within each university private network that is not shared with other universities due to lack of virtual collaboration on a grid computing platform. Knowledge building and management in a country is a function of the information that one could have access to with ease but non-collaboration of the universities in a virtual environment is a hindrance to quality national knowledge building and management. Thus the need arises to embrace grid system as platform for all universities to pool their resources together and hence make their information resources available and accessible for knowledge building and management. This report presents an overview of Nigeria universities’ operations as regard their research and innovation policies and vis-à-vis governance and resource management across public and private universities. Also we did a systematic review and analysis of knowledge grid (KG) technology vis-à-vis its use for knowledge management in Nigerian universities. We focused on identifying the strengths and challenges of knowledge grid development and implementation vis-à-vis the technological, economic and social implications involved in the process.

Thus, cyberinfrastructure with latency-optimal network intelligence services (NIS), in which application data flows are deeply examined in real-time, is inevitable. In the future internet system, a set of NIS can flexibly be implemented in network function virtualization (NFV)-based middleboxes that overlay on software-defined networking (SDN) architecture, becoming an SDN/NFV-based cyberinfrastructure. However, how to deploy these middleboxes is a non-deterministic optimization problem, which is complicated and time-consuming. Hence, by focusing on latency minimization, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solution consisted of two phases. First, middleboxes placement based on the graph cluster analysis, and second, NIS resource allocation based on the prediction of service usage-ratio in each corresponding cluster. The simulation-based experimental evaluation shows that our proposed strategy using an optimized K-means algorithm outperforms the recent state-of-the-art middleboxes placement approaches. The average end-to-end flow latencies are around 23.81%, 18.44%, and 11.49% lower compared with the simulated annealing method, the basic sequential algorithmic scheme, and the minimum spanning tree procedure, respectively. Besides, the proposed resource allocation scheme optimizes further the latency minimization around 4.24%. We believe that the work presented in this paper will aid the communication service providers (CSP) in providing a secure and low-latency SDN/NFV-based cyberinfrastructure for the EI ecosystem. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; Energy internet; network intelligence; NFV middlebox; SDN architecture,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078479956

Organizations tend to adopt new methodologies for global software development, among which is the use of agile in the GSD industry, which yields both benefits and challenges. However, software development teams do not consider situational needs that delay software delivery, resulting in the late discovery of incompatible assumptions and architecture level rework. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the situational factors that need to be considered by software development teams before developing a software product. We further present taxonomical classification and comprehensively map the situational factors that impact design development and advancement in the proposed Situational Agile Distributed Development (SADD) model. We propose 18 directed hypotheses against each situational factor that supports our SADD model. In order to evaluate our directed hypotheses, statistical analysis method is used, and the level of confidence of each directed hypothesis is validated. The result of our study confirms that global software development teams are highly reliant on the SADD Model. Our study will largely contribute by devising a multilevel taxonomy of situational factors that elevate the performance of global software development teams.

The CCHP has been investigated to reduce energy costs by using the thermal energy generated during the power generation process. For efficient utilization of CCHP and numerous power generation systems, accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) is necessary. So far, even though many single algorithm-based STLF models have been proposed, they showed limited success in terms of applicability and coverage. This problem can be alleviated by combining such single algorithm-based models in ways that take advantage of their strengths.

Given the prevalence of these attacks, considerable research has been conducted on these problems along multiple dimensions. We reexamine the existing research on phishing and spear phishing from the perspective of the unique needs of the security domain, which we call security challenges: real-time detection, active attacker, dataset quality and base-rate fallacy. We explain these challenges and then survey the existing phishing/spear phishing solutions in their light. This viewpoint consolidates the literature and illuminates several opportunities for improving existing solutions. We organize the existing literature based on detection techniques for different attack vectors (e.g., URLs, websites, emails) along with studies on user awareness. For detection techniques we examine properties of the dataset, feature extraction, detection algorithms used, and performance evaluation metrics.

According to the theory of geo-economics, the trading network of the South China Sea Route (SCSR) was constructed on the basis of trade routes and weighted by trade volume. The asymmetric Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) model was introduced to establish a complex network game model of trade cooperation in the SCSR in order to investigate the influencing factors on community cooperation. Through simulation tests, the influence of the participants' cognitive beliefs on self-action sensitivity, cognitive beliefs about the reaction sensitivity of other participants, the proportion of initial collaborators, rewards from neighboring countries, and implementation cost of environmental barriers on the cooperation of the SCSR were investigated. We concluded that the subjective cognitive asymmetry among countries will restrict the trade cooperation of SCSR to a certain extent.

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions: Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Autonomous agents; Deep learning; Empathy; Mental health,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075551716

Although a network-based structure can better capture the micro-level variation of spatio-temporal events, existing deep learning methods of sparse events forecasting are either based on area or grid units due to the data sparsity in both space and time, and the complex network topology. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops the first deep learning (DL) model for network-based predictive mapping of sparse spatio-temporal events. Leveraging a graph-based representation of the network-structured data, a gated localised diffusion network (GLDNet) is introduced, which integrating a gated network to model the temporal propagation and a novel localised diffusion network to model the spatial propagation confined by the network topology. To deal with the sparsity issue, we reformulate the research problem as an imbalance regression task and employ a weighted loss function to train the DL model.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties.

However, due to the uncertainty of incoming wind, the utilization efficiency of wind energy is extremely low, which means the problem of wind curtailment becomes more and more serious. To solve the issue of wind power large-scale consumption, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is established in this paper. Different from other research frameworks, a novel two-side reserve capacity mechanism, which simultaneously takes into account supply side and demand side, is designed to ensure the stable consumption of wind power in the real-time market stage. Specifically, the reserve capacity of thermal power units is considered on the supply side, and the demand response is introduced as the reserve capacity on the demand side. At the same time, the compensation mechanism of reserve capacity is introduced to encourage generation companies (GENCOs) to actively participate in the power balance process of the real-time market. In terms of solution method, compared with the traditional k-means clustering method, this paper uses the K-means classification based on numerical weather prediction (K-means-NWP) scenario clustering method to better describe the fluctuation of wind power output. Finally, an example simulation is conducted to analyze the influence of reserve capacity compensation mechanism and system parameters on wind power consumption results. The results demonstrate that with the introduction of reserve capacity compensation mechanism, the wind curtailment quantity of the power system has a significant reduction. Besides, the income of GENCOs is gradually increasing, which motivates their enthusiasm to provide reserve capacity. Furthermore, the reserve capacity mechanism designed in this paper promotes the consumption of wind power and the sustainable development of renewable energy. © 2019 by the authors.",K-means-NWP; Scheduling model; Two-side reserve capacity mechanism; Two-stage stochastic programming; Wind power,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079503350

These comments can play amarkedly significant role in helping crowdfunding platforms to battle against the bitter challenge of fraudulent activities. We take advantage of the language modeling techniques and aim to merge them with neural networks to identify some hidden discussion patterns in the comments. Our objective is to design a language modeling based neural network architecture, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used to predict discussion trends, i.e., either towards scamor non-scam.

One of the biggest challenges to today's cold chain logistics is to oer fresh food while minimizing CO2 emissions. The fresh degree and CO2 emissions are involved in the vehicle routing optimization problem in the cold chain logistics. In order to meet the quality requirement for fresh agricultural products and low carbon logistics, a novel routing optimization model considering the costs of quality deterioration and carbon emissions (Low Carbon and Freshness Degrees Vehicle Routing Problem (LCFD-VRP) for cold chain distribution was established in this study. This model takes into account the fixed cost, fuel cost and time window penalty cost. An improved ant colony algorithm (IACA) is used to optimize the whole vehicle distribution routing with its strong global search ability. Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is used to search the single vehicle distribution routing with its good local search ability. An IACA combined with TS (IACATS) was proposed to solve the above LCFD-VRP model. The practicability of the model and the effectiveness of the above improved algorithm are verified using a real case study. The results of Zhoushan Dayang Refrigerated Logistics Co., Ltd. showed that, compared with the traditional algorithm, IACATS could reduce the dispatching of two refrigerated vehicles, thus lowering the total cost by 4.94%, shortening the actual transportation distance by 5.50% and cutting the total CO2 emissions by 8.9%. Therefore, the LCFD-VRP model can effectively help to achieve the low carbon emissions, multi-variety and low-cost distribution of fresh agricultural products. The proposed model and IACATS algorithm would be used to optimize VRP in cold chain enterprises. The results of this study also provide management suggestions for cold chain enterprises to effectively balance economic cost and environmental cost. © 2019 by the authors.",CO2 emissions; Cold chain logistics; Fresh degree; Improved ant colony algorithm; Tabu search; Vehicle routing problem,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076580618

Thus, 20 Irish and Chinese micro-influencers were investigated from March 2016 to March 2019, and their microblogs were analyzed by text mining techniques. Consequently, the paper finds four types of keywords that micro-influencers apply to their marketing on social media. Based on the marketing keywords, a digital tool is designed to label fashion keywords in the microblogging automatically. The proposed tool not only contributes to model fashion bloggers' content and increase the influence of marketing on social media but also enlightens marketing scholars to develop digital tools for the sustainability of disseminating research results. © 2019 by the authors.

The activity sectors influencing most the PM2.5 levels in the study area are energy production (22%), agriculture (19%), residential combustion (16%) and road transport (7%). The energy production in inefficient coal-fuelled power plants was identified as one of main source of PM2.5 in the Western Balkans. As for the geographical origin of PM2.5, the transboundary pollution is confirmed as the main origin of PM2.5 (44%) in the investigated cities, while the city own emissions and the national sources outside the concerned city impact on average 22% and 15%, respectively. An association was observed between the long-range transport and the impact of agriculture and energy production, while both local urban emissions and long-range transport were associated with the residential sector. A special attention is given in this study to biomass, a renewable source, which use is often promoted in the frame of climate and energy policies. Nevertheless, the combustion of biomass in inefficient small appliances has considerable particulate matter emissions and therefore this type of practice impacts negatively on air quality. Considering that biomass is traditionally used in South-East Europe as fuel for residential heating, the interpretation of the model results was supported with the estimation of biomass burning contributions to PM2.5 obtained with receptor models and data on biomass fuel consumption from the literature. The analysis of the contributions from biomass burning derived from receptor models suggests that biomass burning is the dominant source within the residential heating sector in the studied area and that the emissions from this source are likely underestimated. This study concludes that more effort is needed to improve the estimations of biomass burning emissions and that policies to improve air quality in the cities should involve a geographic context wider than the city level. © 2019 The Authors",,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073224266

This relates to the recruitment and retention of talented future leaders. This is a long-standing issue but one that is increasing in importance as industry changes, combined with external pressures within the labour market (demographic and competitive), act to restructure the recruitment landscape in many countries. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a literature-based analysis that addresses two key questions relating to the hospitality industry and talent – does the sector need talent and, controversially, does it deserve talent? The literature has been addressed on the basis of the author’s in-depth knowledge and the use of a wide range of pertinent search terms relating to the core themes of hospitality and talent management. Findings: The paper assesses evidence with respect to both questions, framed as propositions, and concludes that the current talent pipelines, upon which hospitality substantially depends, may not be fit for purpose, and that the wider workplace culture within hospitality is not compatible with the attraction of the best into the industry. Research limitations/implications: The paper challenges the established practice, both within the hospitality industry, in terms of its workplace environment, and in the way its educational partners (hospitality management schools) prepare young people for the industry. The outcomes of the analysis do not provide much by way of succour to either. Practical implications: Implicit in this paper is a call to key stakeholders (industry and education) in the search for future leaders of the hospitality industry to address and review both the industry workplace, to make it more attractive and rewarding for young graduates, and the educational model that still dominates hospitality management programmes in preparing them for careers. Social implications: Careers in hospitality will remain “Cinderella” options for young graduates until action is taken by stakeholders to reposition the nature of the careers on offer and the focus of the programmes available in preparation for them. Originality/value: The approach taken is the presentation of widely recognised themes in an original format. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Hospitality; Hospitality management education; Talent; Workforce,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069477024

In this vein, CO2 storage through enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs is touted as a most effective approach because it synergistically increases oil production and enables permanent sequestration into the reservoirs. However, the construction of a reasonable 3D geological model for this storage reservoir is a major challenge. Thus, this study presents an efficient workflow for constructing an accurate geological model for the evaluation of CO2 storage capacity in a fractured basement reservoir in the Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to predict porosity and permeability values through seismic attributes and well log data. The predicted values were selected using high correlation factors with well log data. Subsequently, the Sequential Gaussian Simulation and co-kriging methods were applied to generate a 3D static geological model by using azimuth and dip parameters. Finally, drill stem test matching was performed to validate the accuracy of the porosity and permeability models through dynamic simulation. A validation 3D reservoir model, which integrates geophysical, geological, and engineering data from fractured basement formation in Cuu Long Basin, was further constructed to calculate theoretical CO2 storage capacity. As a result, the calculated storage capacity for the fractured basement reservoir ranged from 7.02 to 99.5 million metric tons. These estimated results demonstrate that fractured basement reservoir has a combined potential for CO2 storage and EOR in the Cuu Long Basin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial neural networks; CO2 storage capacity calculation; Cuu Long Basin; Fractured basement reservoir; Integrated 3D geological model,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071648950

The associated methods of counting remained more or less the same since the 1970s, but suffer from low precision and low accuracy of population estimates. Aerial counts using cost-efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or microlight aircrafts with cameras and an automated animal detection algorithm can potentially improve this precision and accuracy. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the multi-class convolutional neural network RetinaNet in detecting elephants, giraffes and zebras in aerial images from two Kenyan animal counts. The algorithm detected 95% of the number of elephants, 91% of giraffes and 90% of zebras that were found by four layers of human annotation, of which it correctly detected an extra 2.8% of elephants, 3.8% giraffes and 4.0% zebras that were missed by all humans, while detecting only 1.6 to 5.0 false positives per true positive. Furthermore, the animal detections by the algorithm were less sensitive to the sighting distance than humans were. With such a high recall and precision, we posit it is feasible to replace manual aerial animal count methods (from images and/or directly) by only the manual identification of image bounding boxes selected by the algorithm and then use a correction factor equal to the inverse of the undercounting bias in the calculation of the population estimates. This correction factor causes the standard error of the population estimate to increase slightly compared to a manual method, but this increase can be compensated for when the sampling effort would increase by 23%. However, an increase in sampling effort of 160% to 1,050% can be attained with the same expenses for equipment and personnel using our proposed semi-automatic method compared to a manual method. Therefore, we conclude that our proposed aerial count method will improve the accuracy of population estimates and will decrease the standard error of population estimates by 31% to 67%. Most importantly, this animal detection algorithm has the potential to outperform humans in detecting animals from the air when supplied with images taken at a fixed rate. © 2019 The Authors.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Smart Cities Network (ASCN) was initiated to develop a sustainable transport system in the ASEAN countries. A comprehensive understanding of street networks (SNs) can contribute significantly to the achievement of this initiative. Therefore, this paper measured and compared characteristics of drivable street networks (DSNs) and walkable street networks (WSNs) of the 26 ASCN pilot cities by applying multiple network metrics. The OSMnx tool was used to download and analyse WSNs and DSNs from the OpenStreetMap. The findings present the topological and geometric characteristics of WSNs and DSNs that are diverse and characterized by different factors. The cities with orthogonal street grids, high street density, intersection density, and fewer cul-de-sacs have good accessibility to reach destinations. In contrast, some other cities have more curvilinear and circuitous SNs with many missing links to other streets, which in turn are prone to traffic disruption. The study highlights the important features of SNs that have significant implications for future designs of SNs in the ASCN whose goal is to make cities smart and liveable for ASEAN members. © 2019 by the authors.",OpenStreetMap; OSMnx; Smart city; Street network analysis; Urban morphology,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075497376

One of the most important elements that must be defined in the management of information technology services is the construction and management of a service catalog. However, in order to create this catalog, it is necessary to correctly identify the services to be formed. So far, there are several proposals that serve to identify information technology services in public organizations. However, there are several inherent drawbacks to these processes, whereby many organizations are yet to adapt to the services. The main objective of this research is to present a proposal for the identification of information technology services and the construction of an information technology catalog. For this, the following methodology was applied: (a) a review of the literature, identifying the research that addressed the process of the identification of services; (b) a proposal based on automatic learning to identify information technology services in public organizations, adapting the catalog of services and taking as its main input the history of requests and incidents accredited by the department of information technologies in public organizations in the Republic of Ecuador.

The current information and communication technologies provide innovative ways of collecting data on tourist movements, but it is still necessary to evaluate tools and methods of study for this challenge. At this point, mobile technologies are the best candidate for this task. Given the relevance of the topic, this paper proposes a mapping science analysis of publications on ""movement of tourists"" and ""traceability."" It has been carried out in the two main sources WOS and SCOPUS. The term ""traceability"" is brought from industry and technology areas to be applied to the tourist movement/mobility tracking and management. The methodological scheme is based on a selection of search criteria with combinations of terms. The sources of specialized information in applied social sciences and technology were then selected. From there, the searches have been executed for their subsequent analysis in three stages-(I) relevance analysis filtering the results to obtain the most pertinent; (II) analysis of articles with similarity thematic, authors, journals or citations; (III) analysis of selected papers as input for the mapping analysis using Citespace. The automatic naming of clusters under the selected processing confirms that the analysis of movements is a valid scientific trend but research-oriented from the perspective of traceability is non-existent, so this approach is novel and complementary to existing ones and a potential contribution to knowledge about tourist movements. Finally, a set of methodological considerations and a classification of information capture tools are proposed. In this classification, mobile technology is the best option to enable tourist movement analysis. © 2019 by the authors.",Bibliometric; Citespace; Mobile; Pedestrian; Planning; Review; Science mapping; Technology; Tools; Tourist movements; Traceability,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071977225

Recreational fishers are a key user group to consider as their activities can have significant impacts on fish populations. In some contexts, recreational fishers also represent a significant proportion of the public and can hold considerable influence on governing authorities. This issue is particularly pertinent for marine protected areas as significant opposition exists within some local communities, including recreational fishers, and community support is critical to achieving success. An online survey was employed across Western Australia to investigate recreational fishers' motivations and their attitudes towards fisheries management and different types of spatial closures, including marine protected areas. The results show the most specialised fishers demonstrate stronger support for traditional fisheries management compared to other groups, but stronger opposition to closed fishing zones specified as sanctuary zones. In comparison, no strong opposition is present for temporarily closed fishing zones or those protecting unique or fragile places. Our results suggest that rather than spatial fishing closures, it is the designated purpose of sanctuary zones for precautionary management which some specialised fishers reject. Understanding patterns of support are vital for policy-makers to design and communicate policy which is seen as appropriate and legitimate amongst stakeholders, particularly to those specialised fishers who hold significant influence in fishing communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Angling; Attitudes; Fishing regulations; Marine protected areas; Marine reserves; Recreational fisheries management,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067832150

From 2010 onwards, the total number of papers and citations on using AI to manage depressive disorder have risen considerably. In terms of global AI research network, researchers from the United States were the major contributors to this field. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the most well-studied application of AI was the utilization of machine learning to identify clinical characteristics in depression, which accounted for more than 60% of all publications. Latent dirichlet allocation identified specific research themes, which include diagnosis accuracy, structural imaging techniques, gene testing, drug development, pattern recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based diagnosis.

In recent decades, engineers and researchers have proposed several strategies to model and improve driving monitoring and assistance systems (DMAS). This work presents a comprehensive survey of the literature related to driving processes, the main reasons for road accidents, the methods of their early detection, and state-of-the-art strategies developed to assist drivers for a safe and comfortable driving experience. The studies focused on the three main elements of the driving process, viz. driver, vehicle, and driving environment are analytically reviewed in this work, and a comprehensive framework of DMAS, major research areas, and their interaction is explored. A well-designed DMAS improves the driving experience by continuously monitoring the critical parameters associated with the driver, vehicle, and surroundings by acquiring and processing the data obtained from multiple sensors. A discussion on the challenges associated with the current and future DMAS and their potential solutions is also presented. © 2019 by the authors.

The ubiquitous use of IoT ranges from industrial control systems (ICS) to e-Health, e-Commerce, smart cities, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber physical systems (CPS), and a lot more. Such reliance on IoT is resulting in a significant amount of data to be generated, collected, processed, and analyzed. The big data analytics is no doubt beneficial for business development. However, at the same time, numerous threats to the availability and privacy of the user data, message, and device integrity, the vulnerability of IoT devices to malware attacks and the risk of physical compromise of devices pose a significant danger to the sustenance of IoT. This paper thus endeavors to highlight most of the known threats at various layers of the IoT architecture with a focus on the anatomy of malware attacks. We present a detailed attack methodology adopted by some of the most successful malware attacks on IoT, including ICS and CPS. We also deduce an attack strategy of a distributed denial of service attack through IoT botnet followed by requisite security measures.

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted.

A two-stage solution method is then developed. In stage 1, an iterative clustering method based on k-means and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used to locate bus stops aiming at minimizing the number of stops subject to various walking accessibilities. In stage 2, an improved ant colony optimization algorithm (IACO) integrating two local search operators is devised, which is used to generate bus routes with minimal total commuting time. A number of instances of different sizes are generated to verify the solution approach, and the influential factors with respect to total commuting time are analyzed.

The data is analyzed using the partial least squares method. Results show that privacy and security concerns are the two biggest hinderances to the trust building process. The users perceive mobility, and usability to be relative advantages, both of which play a positive role in enhancing the trust levels. The effect of personal innovativeness is also observed to be significant. Interestingly, the effect of social influence on the trust level is not supported, which means that boosting a positive image within the social community will not help in the diffusion and continuance usage of the wearables.

To this end, factors associated with topographic, hydrologic and human characteristics were used to develop indices for flood mapping and assessment. These indices and their components were weighed for flood hazard zoning using two methods: (i) a multi-criterion decision-making model in fuzzy logic and (ii) entropy weight. After preparing the flood hazard map by using the above indices and methods, the characteristics of the change?point were used to assess the role of the check dams in reducing flood risk. The method was used in the Ilanlu catchment, located in the northwest of Hamadan province, Iran, where it is prone to frequent flood events.

However, price fluctuations, environmental concerns, technological development, emerging unconventional resources, energy security challenges, and shipment are some of the forces made the NG market more dynamic and complex. From a policy-making perspective, it is vital to uncover demand-side future trends. This paper proposed an intelligent forecasting model to forecast NG global demand, however investigating a multi-dimensional purified input vector. The model starts with a data mining (DM) step to purify input features, identify the best time lags, and pre-processing selected input vector. Then a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) which is equipped with genetic optimizer is applied to set up ANN's characteristics. Among 13 available input features, six features (e.g., Alternative and Nuclear Energy, CO2 Emissions, GDP per Capita, Urban Population, Natural Gas Production, Oil Consumption) were selected as the most relevant feature via the DM step. Then, the hybrid learning prediction model is designed to extrapolate the consumption of future trends. The proposed model overcomes competitive models refer to different five error based evaluation statistics consist of R2, MAE, MAPE, MBE, and RMSE. In addition, as the model proposed the best input feature set, results compared to the model which used the raw input set, with no DM purification process. The comparison showed that DmGNn overcame dramatically a simple GNn. Also, a looser prediction model, such as a generalized neural network with purified input features obtained a larger R2 indicator (=0.9864) than the GNn (=0.9679). © 2019 by the authors.",Artificial neural network; Data mining; Energy market; Genetic algorithm; Natural gas demands; Prediction,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075565475

If depression is not properly treated, it can develop into a depressive disorder and increase the risk of suicide.Besides biopsychosocial factors, lifestyle is said to be a major cause of this disease and has led to an increase in its prevalence. Objective: The objective of this study was to study the intentions of patients with major depressive disorders and family caregivers to change their health behaviour and lifestyle through social media influences. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Participants were invited to take part in the research and give their informed consent. The sample consisted of 157 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorders, aged 18 years and over, and 110 family caregivers. Data were collected from the questionnaires designed according to the I-Change Model (ICM). Statistical results to confirm causal relationships were analysed based on Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and by using the SmartPLS 3 software. Results: Patients and family caregivers were questioned about their perspectives on health matters and the influence on their motivations and intentions to change patients’ health behaviour and lifestyle, particularly social media interventions. The patients received information and counselling about health matters, health awareness, motivation and their intentions to change their health behaviour. The family caregivers were presented with the same information and counselling to motivate them to influence the depressive patients’ intentions to change their health behaviour. Conclusion: It is possible that lifestyle interventions on social media can influence the intention to change health behaviour in both patients and caregivers. However, if the patient lacks interest in participating in the treatment and does not have a good relationship with the clinician or provide relevant information to the experts; this can be an obstacle to changing their health behaviour. Therefore, future research should be conducted to ascertain which interventions are appropriate for patients and to study the long-term effects of any risks from using social media in patients with major depressive disorders. © 2019 Jattamart & Leelasantitham.",Depressive patients; Family caregivers; Health behaviour change; I-Change model; Lifestyle intervention; Social media,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074215972

The EU-funded H2020-MSCA project 'SECRET' introduced covering the urban landscape with mobile small cells, since these take advantages of the dynamic network topology and optimizes network services in a cost-effective fashion. By taking advantage of the device-to-device communications technology, large amounts of data can be transmitted over multiple hops and, therefore, offload the general network. However, this introduction of mobile small cells presents various security and privacy challenges. Cryptographic security solutions are capable of solving these as long as they are supported by a key management scheme. It is assumed that the network infrastructure and mobile devices from network users are unable to act as a centralized trust anchor since these are vulnerable targets to malicious attacks. Security must, therefore, be guaranteed by means of a key management scheme that decentralizes trust. Therefore, this paper surveys the state-of-the-art key management schemes proposed for similar network architectures (e.g., mobile ad hoc networks and ad hoc device-to-device networks) that decentralize trust.

Here, a novel approach to steganography is suggested using Vigenere Cipher and Huffman Coding methods to encrypt and compress the mystery message content. This approach will raise the security and ensure the message content cannot be extracted without earlier knowledge of decrypting rules and the Huffman Dictionary Table. Later, the image is segmented into blocks, size (w*h) groups for each block and with each group having n pixels. Subsequently, the knight tour algorithm and arbitrary function are utilized to select which blocks and groups can be used to conceal the mystery digit within a specific pixel in the group randomly. This is to address the weakness of the Exploiting Modification Direction (EMD) technique that uses a serial selection to enhance the robustness of the suggested scheme.

Nonetheless, due to its decentralized architecture, fault tolerance and cryptographic security benefits such as pseudonymous identities, data integrity and authentication, researchers and security analysts around the world are focusing on the blockchain to resolve security and privacy issues of IoT. However, presently, not much work has been done to assess blockchain's viability for IoT and the associated challenges. Hence, to arrive at intelligible conclusions, this paper carries out a systematic study of the peculiarities of the IoT environment including its security and performance requirements and progression in blockchain technologies. We have identified the gaps by mapping the security and performance benefits inferred by the blockchain technologies and some of the blockchain-based IoT applications against the IoT requirements. We also discovered some practical issues involved in the integration of IoT devices with the blockchain.

In this paper, we present a novel Multiple Criteria Group Decision Making (MCGDM) methodology to evaluate and rank the medical tourism destinations based on vague information. A systematic assessment and selection model was constructed by investigating MCGDM problems with Neutrosophic Fuzzy Preference Relations (NFPRs). We began by defining NFPRs, which allowed the patient-tourists lacking information, time, or patience to express their uncertainty and hesitancy about the given preference values. The additive consistency and acceptable consistency for NFPRs were then proposed. Furthermore, the approach to improve consistency of NFPRs was validated and a series of aggregation operators were developed. In addition, we presented a systematic MCGDM method using NFPRs (MCGDM-NFPRs) to rank the medical tourism destinations. Then, our proposed approach was applied to two cases considering different kinds of original data to prioritize medical tourism places. Finally, the applicability and feasibility of the proposed approach were verified by comparison with other previous methods, along with some analyses and a comprehensive discussion. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

They have enormous ecological, economic, and social value. However, the world’s mangrove forests are declining under immense pressure from anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Accurate information regarding mangrove forests is essential for their protection and restoration. The main objective of this study was to develop a method to improve the classification of mangrove forests using C-band quad-pol Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (Radarsat-2) and optical data (Landsat 8), and to analyze the spectral and backscattering signatures of mangrove forests. We used a support vector machine (SVM) classification method to classify the land use in Hainan Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve (HDNNR). The results showed that the overall accuracy using only optical information was 83.5%. Classification accuracy was improved to a varying extent by the addition of different radar data. The highest overall accuracy was 95.0% based on a combination of SAR and optical data. The area of mangrove forest in the reserve was found to be 1981.7 ha, as determined from the group with the highest classification accuracy. Combining optical data with SAR data could improve the classification accuracy and be significant for mangrove forest conservation. © 2018 by the authors.

This underscores the cardinal role of IoT on the journey toward the fifth generation of wireless communication systems. IoT technologies augmented with intelligent and big data analytics are expected to rapidly change the landscape of myriads of application domains ranging from health care to smart cities and industrial automations. The emergence of multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology aims at extending cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the radio access network, hence providing real-time, high-bandwidth, low-latency access to radio network resources. IoT is identified as a key use case of MEC, given MEC's ability to provide cloud platform and gateway services at the network edge. MEC will inspire the development of myriads of applications and services with demand for ultralow latency and high quality of service due to its dense geographical distribution and wide support for mobility. MEC is therefore an important enabler of IoT applications and services which require real-time operations.

The study's goal is to construct an indicator system that measures the inclusive growth of 11 coastal provinces and cities in China from five aspects, namely, survival, capacity, development, freedom, and opportunity, examining the area from 2000 to 2015. The system is based on Bossel's basic orientor indicator framework. Dynamic changes in overall levels in the five fields are investigated and spatial differences calculated using the Gini coefficient. Among the provinces, Guangxi shows the strongest survival conditions, giving it an advantage over other regions. Shanghai has the highest level of capacity and freedom. Guangdong has the strongest development momentum, but this appears to be weakening. Finally, Shandong shows many more social opportunities. The study suggests that inclusive growth in the area has increased as a result of the area's rapid development, but the growth rates remain low. The level of inclusive growth shows a large gap across the regions. Gini coefficient differences show that the eastern coastal areas have strong development trends, whereas the northern and southern coastal areas show weaker ones. We also offer suggestions on how to promote inclusive growth in these regions. © 2018 by the authors.",Coastal regions; Gini coefficient; Inclusive growth; Indicator system,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051535432

To effectively manage a multi-vector district requires a holistic perspective in terms of both modelling and optimisation. Current district optimisation strategies found in the literature often consider very simple models for energy generation and conversion technologies. To improve upon the state of the art, more realistic and accurate models must be produced whilst remaining computationally and mathematically simple enough to calculate within short periods. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of modelling techniques for common district energy conversion technologies including Power-to-Gas. In addition, dynamic building modelling techniques are reviewed, as buildings must be considered active and flexible participants in a district energy system. In both cases, a specific focus is placed on artificial intelligence-based models suitable for implementation in the real-time operational optimisation of multi-vector systems. Future research directions identified from this review include the need to integrate simplified models of energy conversion units, energy distribution networks, dynamic building models and energy storage into a holistic district optimisation framework.

To address these issues related to current energy needs depending upon the end user requirements, a coherent, translucent, efficient, and rational energy planning framework has to be identified. This paper presents a comprehensive generalized methodological framework based on the synergies of decision analysis and optimization models for the design of a reliable, robust, and economic microgrid system based on locally available resources for rural communities in developing nations. The framework consists of three different stages. First, decision analysis considering various criterions (technical, social, economic, and environmental) for the selection of suitable energy alternative for designing the microgrid considering multiple scenarios are carried out. Second, the optimal sizing of the various energy resources in different microgrid structures is illustrated. Third, hybrid decision analysis methods are used for selection of the best sustainable microgrid energy system. Finally, the framework presented is then utilized for the design of a sustainable rural microgrid for a remote community located in the Himalayas in India to illustrate its effectiveness. The results obtained show that decision analysis tools provide a real-time solution for rural electrification by binding the synergy between various criteria considering different scenarios. The feasibility analysis using proposed multiyear scalable approach shows its competence not only in determining the suitable size of the microgrid, but also by reducing the net present cost and the cost of electricity significantly. © 2013 IEEE.",hybrid energy system; Microgrid; multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); renewable energy; rural electrification,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046358944

Yet for ES models to be policy-relevant, methodological consensus in mining contexts is needed. We review articles assessing ES in mining areas focusing on freshwater components and policy support potential. Twenty-six articles were analysed concerning (i) methodological complexity (data types, number of parameters, processes and ecosystem-human integration level) and (ii) potential applicability for policy development (communication of uncertainties, scenario simulation, stakeholder participation and management recommendations). Articles illustrate mining impacts on ES through valuation exercises mostly. However, the lack of ground- and surface-water measurements, as well as insufficient representation of the connectivity among soil, water and humans, leave room for improvements. Inclusion of mining-specific environmental stressors models, increasing resolution of topographies, determination of baseline ES patterns and inclusion of multi-stakeholder perspectives are advantageous for policy support. We argue that achieving more holistic assessments exhorts practitioners to aim for high social-ecological connectivity using mechanistic models where possible and using inductive methods only where necessary. Due to data constraints, cause-effect networks might be the most feasible and best solution. Thus, a policy-oriented framework is proposed, in which data science is directed to environmental modelling for analysis of mining impacts on water ES. © 2018 by the authors.",Ecosystem services; Mining; Policy support; Water resources,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046089021

Electricity demand is significantly affected by non-linear factors, such as climatic conditions, calendar components and seasonal behavior, which have been widely reported in the literature. This paper considers parsimonious forecasting models to explain the importance of atmospheric variables for hourly electricity demand forecasting. Many researchers include temperature as a major weather component. If temperature is included in a model, other weather components, such as relative humidity and wind speed, are considered as less effective. However, several papers mention that there is a significant impact of atmospheric variables on electricity demand. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the following atmospheric variables: rainfall, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and cloud cover to improve the forecasting accuracy. We construct three different multiple linear models (Model A, Model B, and Model C) including the auto-regressive moving average with exogenous variables (ARMAX) with the mentioned exogenous weather variables to compare the performances for Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The Bayesian approach is applied to estimate the weight of each variable with Gibbs sampling to approximate the estimation of the coefficients. The overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) performances of Model A, Model B, and Model C are estimated as 2.43%, 1.98% and 1.72%, respectively. This means that the accuracy is improved by 13.4% by including rainfall, snowfall, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, and cloud cover data. The results of the statistical test indicate that these atmospheric variables and the improvement in accuracy are statistically significant in most of the hours. More specifically, they are significant during highly fluctuating and peak hours. © 2018 by the authors.

These file systems are often compatible with local file systems due to their use of the POSIX interface and semantics, which eases development and debugging because applications can easily run both on workstations and supercomputers. There is a wide variety of file systems to choose from, each tuned for different use cases and implementing different optimizations. However, the overall application performance is often held back by I/O bottlenecks due to insufficient performance of file systems or I/O libraries for highly parallel workloads. Performance problems are dealt with using novel storage hardware technologies as well as alternative I/O semantics and interfaces. These approaches have to be integrated into the storage stack seamlessly to make them convenient to use. Upcoming storage systems abandon the traditional POSIX interface and semantics in favor of alternative concepts such as object and key-value storage; moreover, they heavily rely on technologies such as NVM and burst buffers to improve performance. Additional tiers of storage hardware will increase the importance of hierarchical storage management. Many of these changes will be disruptive and require application developers to rethink their approaches to data management and I/O.

This function is effective in an environment where hard cash is in uninterrupted circulation. The aim of this paper is to investigate implications of cash liquidity challenges in Zimbabwe to the development of financial inclusion through MMAs in a rural set-up. Phenomenological in-depth interviews were conducted with MMAs. Due to national liquidity challenges, MMAs ceased to receive cash float support, limiting their cash-in and cash-out services. Pure agents were adversely affected, while those who operate retail goods services reported increased goods sales through mobile money point-of-sale payments. Consumers are restricted to deal in electronic funds in the cashless economy making the cash-in and cash-out function of MMAs redundant. MMAs need support to sustain their operations and recoup invested capital in infrastructure. Risk management strategies, including the principal-agent contracts that minimize the exposure of MMAs to disruption of the service are important. MMAs could form an association to lobby financial regulators for support, negotiation with principals, market research, political power and active participation of agents in deepening financial inclusion. Perhaps pure MMAs could improve their economic sustainability by diversifying their businesses. © The author(s) 2019.",Financial inclusion; Liquidity challenges; Mobile money agents; Principal-agent contract; Unbanked; Zimbabwe,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063176699

Dengue outbreaks are endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, mainly in urban and sub-urban areas. The outbreak is one of the top 10 diseases causing the most deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, dengue infection has increased 30-fold globally over the past five decades. About 50-100 million new infections occur annually in more than 80 countries. Many researchers are working on measures to prevent and control the spread. One avenue of research is collaboration between computer science and the epidemiology researchers in developing methods of predicting potential outbreaks of dengue infection. An important research objective is to develop models that enable, or enhance, forecasting of outbreaks of dengue, giving medical professionals the opportunity to develop plans for handling the outbreak, well in advance. Researchers have been gathering and analyzing data to better identify the relational factors driving the spread of the disease, as well as the development of a variety of methods of predictive modeling using statistical and mathematical analysis and machine learning. In this substantial review of the literature on the state of the art of research over the past decades, we identified six main issues to be explored and analyzed: 1) the available data sources; 2) data preparation techniques; 3) data representations; 4) forecasting models and methods; 5) dengue forecasting models evaluation approaches; and 6) future challenges and possibilities in forecasting modeling of dengue outbreaks.

Several classes of contact scenario are examined, and existing approaches to the search for extra-terrestrial life and intelligence are situated within the range of possible search strategies and targets illuminated by this particular choice of parameters, as are some examples of contact scenarios from popular culture. The resulting possibility space can also suggest new search strategies and potential targets, one of which is highlighted—that of ‘galaxy-scale macro-engineering’. It is hypothesised that an example of this might already be known to us, namely the intriguing galaxy ‘Hoag's Object’ (PGC54559), and some specific empirical observations are suggested in order to test this hypothesis.

Theoretical and methodological challenges exist in assessing ecological risk of watershed ecosystem that is imposed by natural changes or human activities. To fill this research gap, this research proposes an interdisciplinary and quantitative methodology based on some techniques such as the Procedure for Ecological Tiered Assessment of Risk (PETAR), the Entropy, and the Celluar Automata Markov (CA-Markov). We focused on six vulnerable environmental variables, namely land-use change, water quantity, water quality, gross domestic product (GDP), environmental pollutants, and soil erosion in the Huai River watershed in the Henan Province in order to build multi-dimensional quantitative method. Further, the Coupling Coordination Degree Model is constructed, and the ""threshold index"" is also addressed to reflect the limitation of ecological risk. Our results show that the spatio-temperal distribution of the eco-environmental quality has greatly varied across this study area during different time spans. Natural eco-environmental quality has moderately degraded in 70% of this study area (mainly agricultural region), at a prefectural level from 2000 to 2010, and has slightly improved over the agricultural region ( < 170 m above sea level) during 2010-2015. However, when considering negative stressors from human social system on the natural ecosystem, the extent and distribution of the ecological risk varied across the whole area during 2000-2015. The results show that there was almost 90.40% of this region under the ecological risk, with varying extents over the study time, e.g., Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Xuchang, and Xinyang, with a moderate deterioration in the eco-environmental quality, and Zhengzhou with a slight deterioration in the eco-environmental quality.

BIM has advantages on rich geometric and semantic information through the building life cycle, while GIS is a broad field covering geovisualization-based decision making and geospatial modelling. However, most current studies of BIM-GIS integration focus on the integration techniques but lack theories and methods for further data analysis and mathematic modelling. This paper reviews the applications and discusses future trends of BIM-GIS integration in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry based on the studies of 96 high-quality research articles from a spatio-temporal statistical perspective. The analysis of these applications helps reveal the evolution progress of BIM-GIS integration. Results show that the utilization of BIM-GIS integration in the AEC industry requires systematic theories beyond integration technologies and deep applications of mathematical modeling methods, including spatio-temporal statistical modeling in GIS and 4D/nD BIM simulation and management. Opportunities of BIM-GIS integration are outlined as three hypotheses in the AEC industry for future research on the in-depth integration of BIM and GIS.

Strong security measures, forensic tools, and investigators contribute together to detect and mitigate those attacks, reducing the damages and enabling reestablishing the network to its normal operation, thus increasing the cybersecurity of the networked environment. This paper addresses the use of a forensic approach with Deep Packet Inspection to detect anomalies in the network traffic. As cyber attacks may occur on any layer of the TCP/IP networking model, Deep Packet Inspection is an effective way to reveal suspicious content in the headers or the payloads in any packet processing layer, excepting of course situations where the payload is encrypted. Although being efficient, this technique still faces big challenges. The contributions of this paper rely on the association of Deep Packet Inspection with forensics analysis to evaluate different attacks towards a Honeynet operating in a network laboratory at the University of Brasilia. In this perspective, this work could identify and map the content and behavior of attacks such as the Mirai botnet and brute-force attacks targeting various different network services. Obtained results demonstrate the behavior of automated attacks (such as worms and bots) and non-automated attacks (brute-force conducted with different tools). The data collected and analyzed is then used to generate statistics of used usernames and passwords, IP and services distribution, among other elements.

Objectives: Our objectives were to: (1) compare multiple modelling approaches, (2) evaluate the utility of landscape composition and configuration as predictors, (3) assess the influence of the ratio of forest loss and persistence points in the training sample, (4) identify the multiple-scale drivers of recent forest loss and (5) predict future forest loss risk across Borneo. Methods: We compared random forest machine learning and logistic regression in a multi-scale approach to model forest loss risk between 2000 and 2010 as a function of topographical variables and landscape structure, and applied the highest performing model to predict the spatial pattern of forest loss risk between 2010 and 2020. We utilized a naïve model as a null comparison and used the total operating characteristic AUC to assess model performance. Results: Our analysis produced five main results. We found that: (1) random forest consistently outperformed logistic regression and the naïve model; (2) including landscape structure variables substantially improved predictions; (3) a ratio of occurrence to non-occurrence points in the training dataset that does not match the actual ratio in the landscape biases the predictions of both random forest and logistic regression; (4) forest loss risk differed between the three nations that comprise Borneo, with patterns in Kalimantan highly related to distance from the edge of the previous frontier of forest loss, while Malaysian Borneo showed a more diffuse pattern related to the structure of the landscape; (5) we predicted continuing very high rates of forest loss in the 2010–2020 period, and produced maps of the expected risk of forest loss across the full extent of Borneo. Conclusions: These results confirm that multiple-scale modelling using landscape metrics as predictors in a random forest modelling framework is a powerful approach to landscape change modelling. There is immense immanent risk to Borneo’s forests, with clear spatial patterns of risk related to topography and landscape structure that differ between the three nations that comprise Borneo. © 2017, The Author(s).",Borneo; Forest cover; Forest loss; Land-use change; Logistic regression; Random forest; Total operating characteristic,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019875101

What happens in languages that don't seem to do anything special? The contributions in this special issue all focus on the various ways in which natural languages express reflexivity, and how the challenges their diversity poses can be addressed. In this contribution I present and further develop my answers to these questions, showing that except for a definition of binding no principles specific to binding need to be assumed. Sections 3–7 provide an overview of issues against which the results of current binding research are to be interpreted. I briefly address the role of phases in the theory of binding and argue that phases are relevant only indirectly namely in so far as the operations involved in the encoding of binding dependencies are themselves sensitive to phase-hood. I also relate my account to current debates about the relation between syntax and morphology (as in Distributed Morphology), showing that a too loose connection between syntax and morphology leads to severe methodological problems.

Geddesian concepts have greatly revolutionized the design and building of modern cities around the world. As a botanist and a scientist, Geddes incorporated the concept of the appearance of gardens when designing towns. His success in pioneering the planning of his city of residence in Scotland inspired further involvement in designing towns and the renovation of old structures and buildings. His concepts regarding the planning and development of towns and cities have created a foundation of interest in research, professionalism, and educational development. This study analyses the concepts of space, communities, and smart cities, and repositions Geddesian ideas in contemporary learning strategies in relation to the wider political spectrum associated with the paradigm of smart cities. The authors explore the relevance of his thoughts and perspectives in the current design environment geared towards the creation of smart cities. The study also evaluates the challenges of developing smart cities in relation to Patrick Geddes's ideas. © 2016 by the authors.",Community; Patrick Geddes; Smart cities; Urban planning,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994852326

While based primarily on the author's experience and insights at major companies where he has served as CISO and CSPO, the book also includes many examples from other well-known companies and provides guidance for a management-level audience. Managing Risk and Information Security provides thought leadership in the increasingly important area of enterprise information risk and security. It describes the changing risk environment and why a fresh approach to information security is needed. Because almost every aspect of an enterprise is now dependent on technology not only for internal operations but increasing as a part of product or service creation, the focus of IT security must shift from locking down assets to enabling the business while managing and surviving risk. This edition discusses business risk from a broader perspective, including privacy and regulatory considerations. It describes the increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities and offers strategies for developing solutions. These include discussions of how enterprises can take advantage of new and emerging technologies-such as social media and the huge proliferation of Internet-enabled devices-while minimizing risk. © 2016 by Malcolm W.

The ecosystem-health relationship, however, is characterized by several complexity aspects, such as multiple and diverse health impacts - both positive and negative - and a strong interaction with socio-economic factors. As these aspects strongly determine the outcomes of the ecosystem-human health relationship, they should be accounted for in assessments. We identified 14 ecosystem services and six ecosystem disservices with a direct impact on human health. An extensive search and selection procedure yielded eleven computer-based tools that we evaluated regarding their suitability for assessment of the ecosystem-health relationship. Nine of 14 health-related ecosystem services are addressed by one or more of these tools. However, most tools do not include the final step of actually assessing the associated health outcomes such as mortality or disease incidence. Furthermore, the review shows that each complexity aspect is addressed by several of the evaluated tools, but always in an incomplete way. We recommend that further tool development should focus on improved integration of socio-economic factors and inclusion of ecosystem disservices. This would allow better assessment of the net contribution of ecosystems to human health. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Computer-based tools; Ecosystem assessment; Ecosystem disservices; Ecosystem services; Human health,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956689952

It has been proved that, compared with driving individually, such a platoon-based driving pattern can significantly improve road capacity and energy efficiency. Moreover, with the emerging vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the performance of a platoon in terms of road capacity, safety, energy efficiency, etc., can be further improved. On the other hand, the physical dynamics of vehicles inside the platoon can also affect the performance of a VANET. Such a complex system can be considered a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS), which has attracted significant attention recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on a platoon-based VCPS. We first review the related work of a platoon-based VCPS. We then introduce two elementary techniques involved in a platoon-based VCPS, i.e., the vehicular networking architecture and standards, and traffic dynamics, respectively. We further discuss the fundamental issues in a platoon-based VCPS, including vehicle platooning/clustering, cooperative adaptive cruise control, platoon-based vehicular communications, etc., all of which are characterized by the tightly coupled relationship between traffic dynamics and VANET behaviors. Since system verification is critical to VCPS development, we also give an overview of VCPS simulation tools. Finally, we share our view on some open issues that may lead to new research directions. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC); Cyber-physical system (CPS); Platoon; Platoon-based vehicular communications; Simulator; Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET),Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962359205

Since 2009, a hunting programme to control the feral livestock has been in operation. However long-term funding is not assured. Here, we estimate the effect of feral livestock control on ecosystem services provided by the forest to evaluate whether the biodiversity conservation rationale for continuation of the control programme is supported by an economic case. A new practical tool (Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment) was employed to measure and compare ecosystem service provision between two states of the reserve (i.e. presence and absence of feral livestock control) to estimate the net consequences of the hunting programme on ecosystem services provided by the forest. Based on this we estimate that cessation of feral livestock management would substantially reduce the net benefits provided by the site, including a 46 % reduction in nature-based tourism (from $419,000 to $228,000) and 36 % reduction in harvested wild meat (from $205,000 to $132,000). The overall net benefit generated from annual ecosystem service flows associated with livestock control in the reserve, minus the management cost, was $214,000 per year. We conclude that continued feral livestock control is important for maintaining the current level of ecosystem services provided by the reserve. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Carbon; Feral livestock; Guava; Harvested wild goods; Java plum; Nature-based tourism; Non-native; TESSA,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940264911

The strategic nature of the service relies on the objective of simplifying communication between all parties of the society: government, citizens and business. The use of ICTs can help to connect all three parties and facilitate processes and activities that support their connectivity. Therefore, eGovernment encourages good governance. However, with the nature of ICTs constantly changing, the subsequent economic and societal impact in Europe is diversified. Continued technological progress has led to a societal acceptance of the new technologies, amount to a step-change in what ICT can achieve. Rapid technological developments have altered the level of government engagement within the society. Our point of interest, European societies, has demonstrated diversified levels of government and citizen engagement. For some EU countries’ citizens, interaction with the government through online facilities is not a novelty. However, to achieve the same level of efficiency and flexibility for all the EU member-countries is going to be challenging. The experience from the eGovernment services in the European Union shows that the willingness to decentralize procedures and mainly responsibility, and upgrade the role of electronic means, can strengthen governance. Our case study from Europe 2020 will showcase the dynamic shift of political direction towards flexible public services. The diversity of eGovernment implications in the European Union remains exceptionally interesting. This article is going to examine the political issues related to governance in the European Union, from the perspective of democratic governance. Additionally, it will observe how far the European countries have been successful in implementing the EU’s action plan. The article tries to identify the current status and the progression achieved so far in EU, with regards to the eGovernment area. Specific reference is being made to the open government approach, attempting to identify the level of political creativity originated in the Europe 2020 Initiative.
